            YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.<br><br>NATOPS manuals are kept current through an active manual change program. Any corrections, additions, or constructive suggestions for improvement of its contents should be submitted by urgent, priority or routine change recommendations, as appropriate.<br><br>NATOPS FLIGHT MANUAL INTERIM CHANGES.<br><br>Interim changes are changes or corrections to NATOPS manuals promulgated by CNO or COMNAVAIRSYSCOM. Interim changes are issued either as printed pages, or as a naval message.<br>The Interim Change Summary page is provided as a record of all interim changes. Upon receipt of a change or revision, the custodian of the manual should check the updated Interim Change Summary to ascertain that all outstanding interim changes have been either incorporated or canceled; those not incorporated shall be recorded as outstanding in the section provided.<br><br>CHANGE SYMBOLS.<br><br>Revised text is indicated by a black vertical line in either margin of the page, like the one printed next to this paragraph. The change symbol shows where there has been a change. The change might be material added or information restated. A change symbol in the margin by the chapter number and title indicated a new or completely revised chapter.<br><br>WARNING, CAUTIONS, AND NOTES.<br><br>The following definitions apply to WARNINGs, CAUTIONs, and Notes found throughout the manual.<br>An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., that may result in injury or death, if not carefully observed or followed.<br>An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., that may result in damage to equipment, if not carefully observed or followed.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., which is essential to emphasize.<br><br>WORDING.<br><br>The concept of word usage and intended meaning which has been adhered to in preparing this <br>manual is as follows:<br><br>″Land as soon as possible″ means to land at the first site which a safe landing can be made.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINAL54.<br><br>

            ″Land as soon as practical″ means extended flight is not recommended. The landing site and duration of flight is at the discretion of the pilot in command.<br>‘‘Shall’’ has been used only when application of a procedure is mandatory.<br>‘‘Should’’ has been used only when application of a procedure is recommended.<br>‘‘May’’ and ‘‘need not’’ have been used only when application of a procedure is optional.<br>‘‘Will’’ has been used only to indicate futurity, never to indicate any degree of requirement for application of a procedure.<br><br>AIRSPEED.<br><br>All airspeeds in this manual are in knots calibrated airspeeds unless stated in other terms.<br><br>TERMINOLOGY.<br><br>To standardize terminology throughout this publication, the following guidelines should be followed:<br>a. When specifying a switch, handle, or knob to be actuated in an emergency procedure, the name of the switch, handle or knob should be written as it is labeled in the cockpit (i.e. LDG GEAR handle).<br>b. When referencing a position of a switch, handle, or knob, the label as shown in the cockpit should be used (i.e. ECS MODE switch − OFF/RAM).<br>. c. LOT numbers should be used vice BUNO numbers when the entire LOT is affected. Formultiple LOTs use LOT XX−XX or LOT XX and up as appropriate.<br>. d. For MC OFP’s use terminology such as ″Prior to MC OFP 18E″ or ″MC OFP 18E and up″ toavoid requiring a NATOPS change with each subsequent OFP release.<br>e. Procedures which are nested in other procedures such as the Emergency Oxygen Procedure should contain only immediate action items.<br>f. When emergency procedures are referenced in the PCL, page numbers should be included to facilitate quick location of the referenced procedure.<br><br>MANUAL DEVELOPMENT.<br><br>This NATOPS Flight Manual was prepared using a concept that provides the aircrew with information for operation of the aircraft, but detailed operation and interaction is not provided. This concept was selected for a number of reasons: reader interest increases as the size of a technical publication decreases, comprehension increases as the technical complexity decreases, and accidents decrease as reader interest and comprehension increase. To implement this streamlined concept, <br>observance of the following rules was attempted:<br><br>a. The pilot shall be considered to have above-average intelligence and normal (average) common sense.<br>b. No values (pressure, temperature, quantity, etc.) which cannot be read in the cockpit are stated, <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINAL55.<br><br>

            CHAPTER 1.<br><br><br>The Aircraft.<br><br><br>. 1.1 AIRCRAFT DESCRIPTION.<br><br><br>. 1.1.1 Meet The Hornet. The F/A-18A/C Hornet is a single-place fighter/attack aircraft built by.<br><br>McDonnell Douglas Aerospace. See figure 1-1 for general arrangement and Cockpits Foldout section for cockpit arrangement. It is powered by two General Electric F404-GE-400 or F404-GE-402 (enhanced performance) turbofan engines with afterburner. The aircraft features a variable camber mid-wing with leading edge extensions (LEX) mounted on each side of the fuselage from the wing roots to just forward of the windshield. The twin vertical stabilizers are angled outboard 20°from the vertical. The wings have hydraulically actuated leading edge and trailing edge flaps and ailerons. The twin rudders and differential stabilators are also hydraulically actuated. The speed brake is mounted on the top side of the aft fuselage between the vertical stabilizers. The pressurized cockpit is enclosed by an electrically operated clam shell canopy. An aircraft mounted auxiliary power unit (APU) is used to start the engines. On the ground, the APU may be used to supply air conditioning or electrical and hydraulic power to the aircraft systems.<br><br>. 1.1.2 Aircraft Dimensions. The approximate dimensions of the aircraft are as follows:<br><br><br>Span (Wings Spread).<br><br>with missiles without missiles 40 feet 5 inches 37 feet 6 inches Span (Wings Folded) 27 feet 6 inches <br>Length 56 feet.<br><br>Height (To Top of Fins) 15 feet 3 inches Height (To Top of Closed Canopy) 10 feet 6 inches . 1.1.3 Aircraft Gross Weight. Basic aircraft gross weight varies from 24,000 to 25,000 pounds. Refer toapplicable DD 365F for accurate aircraft weight.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-1-1.<br><br>

            CHAPTER 2.<br><br><br>Systems.<br><br><br>. 2.1 POWER PLANT SYSTEMS.<br><br><br>. 2.1.1 Engines. The aircraft is powered by two General Electric engines: F404-GE-400 in Lot 13 and.<br><br>below and either F404-GE-400 or F404-GE-402 in Lot 14 and up. The military thrust of each F404-GE-400 engine is approximately 10,700 pounds with maximum afterburner thrust in the 16,000 pound class. The military thrust of each F404-GE-402 engine is approximately 10,900 pounds with maximum afterburner thrust in the 18,000 pound class. The aircraft thrust-to-weight ratio is in the 1 to 1 class. The engine is a low bypass axial-flow turbofan with afterburner. The three-stage fan (low pressure compressor) is driven by a single stage turbine. Approximately one-third of the fan discharge air is bypassed to the afterburner for combustion and cooling. The seven-stage high pressure compressor is also driven by a single stage turbine. The first and second stage compressor stators are variable. Fourth stage compressor air is used by the engine anti-ice system. A set of variable inlet guide vanes are mounted in front of both the fan and compressor to direct the inlet air at the best angle for the existing engine operation. Atomized fuel and compressor discharge air is mixed and ignited in the combustion chamber. These ignited gases then pass through the compressor and fan turbines and out the engine exhaust. Afterburner operation uses added atomized fuel mixed with the combustion discharge gases and the bypass fan discharge air to produce additional thrust. The electrical control assembly, variable exhaust nozzles, main fuel control, and afterburner fuel control provide coordinated operation of the engine through every part of its envelope. The engine accessory gearbox, driven by the compressor rotor, powers the lubrication and scavenge oil pumps, variable exhaust nozzle power unit, alternator, main fuel pump and control, and afterburner fuel pump and control.

The system uses a fixed geometry compression ramp, a fuselage boundary layer diverter system and a ramp boundary layer bleed system.

            . 2.1.1.1.1 Inlet Duct Doors. The electrically operated inlet duct doors (one for each inlet) automati-cally open at Mach 1.33 (accelerating) and close at Mach 1.23 (decelerating). The doors are controlled by the flight control computer.<br>. 2.1.1.2 Engine Control System. The engine control system consists of the throttle, main fuel control,electrical control assembly (ECA) and afterburner fuel control. Throttle movement is mechanically transmitted to a power lever control. The power lever control acts as a power booster and positions the main fuel control. If the automatic throttle control is engaged, it schedules the power lever control for existing engine power requirements and the throttle follows this movement. Below MIL power, throttle movement and compressor inlet temperature (through the main fuel control) control the compressor speed (rpm). At MIL and above, fan speed is controlled by the ECA as a function of inlet temperature.<br>At and above military power, the ECA senses engine and aircraft parameters, computes engine schedules and maintains engine limits.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>A lockup device in the main fuel control prevents thrust reduction below military if aircraft speed is Mach 1.23 or higher.<br><br>. 2.1.1.3 Afterburner Fuel Control. The afterburner fuel control schedules fuel flow to the pilot.<br><br>spraybar and main spraybars. When the throttle is advanced to afterburner, ignition is turned on, the exhaust nozzle opens slightly above the MIL position, the low pressure turbine discharge temperature schedule is temporarily reset to a lower value, and afterburner pilot spraybar fuel flow and minimum afterburner main fuel flow begins. When afterburner light-off is detected, ignition is turned off and afterburner main fuel flow increases to the level selected by the throttle position. Since main fuel flow is withheld until a positive light-off is attained, a hard light should not occur. Refer to figure 2-1 for afterburner light-off time. A successful afterburner light-off is indicated by the exhaust nozzle opening Figure 2-1. Afterburner Light-Off Time <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-2.<br><br>

The ignition system contains an independent engine mounted alternator,.<br><br>electrical control unit, ignition exciter, a main igniter and an afterburner igniter. During engine start, moving the throttle from OFF to IDLE turns on ignition. Ignition remains on until the engine reaches 45% rpm. Engine ignition also comes on if a flame-out occurs or when afterburner is selected.<br>Afterburner ignition comes on when the throttle is moved into afterburner and remains on until an afterburner light-off is sensed. If more than 50% afterburner is selected, ignition is automatically turned on if an afterburner blowout occurs.<br><br>. 2.1.1.5 Lubrication System. The lubrication system is self-contained and consists of a pressure-.<br><br>filled supply tank, lubrication pump, scavenge pumps, oil filter, oil cooler, gearbox, engine sumps, scavenge screens, magnetic chip detectors, pressure transducer, pressure regulator, and interconnect- ing piping. Oil gravity-flows from the tank to the pump. A pressure transducer, the engine oil pressure transmitter, is located in the pump output line. The engine oil pressure transmitter is an electrical transmitter that does not have any control authority and is used for monitoring purposes only. The engine oil pressure transmitter sends an electrical signal to the cockpit pressure indicator. The loss of engine oil pressure would lead to engine vibrations, RPM would decrease, and the engine would eventually seize.<br><br>. 2.1.1.6 Engine Anti-Ice.

Finger lifts, on the front of each throttle, must be raised to place the throttles OFF. With weight on the wheels, launch bar retracted and the arresting hook UP or with weight off the wheels, afterburner operation is initiated by advancing the throttles through the MIL detent gates into MAX. On the ground, an afterburner lockout system helps guard against inadvertent afterburner selection. With weight on the wheels and launch bar extended or the arresting hook DOWN, the afterburner lockout extends and the finger lifts must be raised or a force of approximately 32 pounds must be applied before the throttles can be moved to MAX.

Automatic transition between the two modes or single-engine engagement is not possible.

If a force of approximately 12 pounds (with friction off) is applied to either throttle the system automatically disengages. This force is sufficient to permit the hand to follow throttle movement without causing disengagement. It is recommended that the friction lever be in the full aft position and both throttles set between flight idle and MIL before engaging ATC. If a mechanical failure occurs, a force of approximately 68 pounds (with friction off) is required to override the system.

Do not utilize the auto throttle system. Use of ATC with these codes could result in uncommanded throttle movements.<br><br>. 2.1.2.1 ATC Approach Mode. The ATC approach mode is engaged by pressing and releasing the.<br><br>ATC button on the left throttle with the FLAP switch in HALF or FULL and the trailing edge flaps extended at least 27°. When ATC is engaged in the approach mode, the flight control computer modulates engine thrust to maintain on-speed AOA. The computer uses inputs of AOA, normal load factor, stabilator position, pitch rate, and angle of bank to generate command signals. These signals drive the engine mounted throttle control units which in turn command the engine fuel controls. The computer uses AOA as the primary input to generate command signals. However, normal load factor provides increased stability, stabilator position provides increased or decreased thrust for pilot induced pitch changes, pitch rate provides lead during pitch maneuvers, and bank angle provides additional thrust during banking maneuvers.

            . 2.1.2.2 ATC Cruise Mode. The ATC cruise mode is engaged by pressing and releasing the ATC.<br><br>button on the left throttle with the FLAP switch in AUTO. When ATC is engaged in the cruise mode, the existing airspeed is used by the flight control computer to modulate engine thrust to maintain this existing airspeed. The existing airspeed is the airspeed being sent from the ADC to the flight control computers via the mission computers. An ADC failure inhibits the ATC cruise mode of operation. The FCC uses true airspeed from ADC via the mission computers at the time of engagement to generate a command signal. This signal is then used as a reference to generate an error signal that drives the engine mounted throttle control units. Normal disengagement is accomplished by pressing the ATC button or applying and holding force to either throttle.

Fuel is carried internally in four interconnected fuselage tanks and two internal wing (wet) tanks. External fuel is carried in 315 or 330 gallon tanks which may be mounted on the centerline and/or inboard wing station pylons. A fuel quantity indicating system provides fuel quantity indications in pounds. All tanks may be refueled on the ground through a single pressure refueling point. Airborne, they can be refueled through the aerial refueling probe. The internal wing tanks, tank 1, and tank 4 are transfer tanks. Tanks 2 and 3 are engine feed tanks. The tanks are arranged so internal fuel gravity transfers (at a reduced rate) even if the transfer pumps fail. Regulated engine bleed air pressure transfers fuel from the external tanks and also provides a positive pressure on all internal fuel tanks. Float type fuel level control valves control refueling of all tanks. These same valves are used to control transfer from the internal wing tanks to tanks 1 and 4 in A/B aircraft, and to tank 2 from the left wing tank and to tank 3 from the right wing tank in F/A-18C/D aircraft. Jet level sensors are used to control transfer from tanks 1 and 4 to tanks 2 and 3. All internal and external tanks except tanks 2 and 3 (and internal wing tanks in F/A-18C/D aircraft) may be dumped overboard from an outlet in each vertical fin. All internal fuel tanks are vented through the vent outlet in each vertical fin. The external tanks are vented through the vent outlets in their individual tanks.<br><br>. 2.2.1 Survivability. The internal wing tanks contain foam for fire/explosion protection. The lower.<br><br>section of the feed tanks are self sealing for “get home” protection. Fuel lines are routed inside the tanks where possible. Fuel feed lines in the main landing gear wells are wrapped with a self-sealing protective shell.<br><br>. 2.2.2 Fuel Tank Pressurization and Vent. The pressurization and vent system provides regulated.<br><br>engine bleed air pressure to all internal tanks to prevent fuel boil-off at altitude and to the external tanks for fuel transfer. The system also provides pressure relief of the fuel tanks during climbs and vacuum relief of the fuel tanks during descent if the pressurization system fails. All tanks are pressurized any time engine bleed air is available, electrical power is on, weight is off the main gear, the air refueling probe is retracted, and in F/A-18A/B aircraft, the HOOK handle is UP or in F/A-18C/D aircraft, either the HOOK handle or the LDG GEAR handle is UP.

            pressurized any time by placing either external tank fuel control switch to ORIDE (HOOK handle must be up in A/B aircraft). The internal tanks vent into the fuselage vent tank which in turn is vented through the vertical fin vent tanks to an outlet in each vertical fin. Any fuel in the vertical fin vent tank returns to the vent tank by gravity flow. Any fuel that accumulates in the vent tank is returned to tanks 2 and 3 by scavenge pumps.<br><br>. 2.2.2.1 Tank Pressurization Caution Display. With MC OFP 10A AND UP, a TANK PRESS.<br><br>caution indicates the internal tanks are pressurized on the ground, or low internal tank pressure inflight above 20,000 feet. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, a TK PRES LO caution indicates low internal tank pressure inflight above 20,000 feet and a TK PRES HI caution indicates the internal tanks are pressurized on the ground, or high internal tank pressure inflight. TANK PRESS or TK PRES LO are also displayed above 20,000 feet when depressurization is caused by extending the inflight refueling probe, or moving the hook handle down (F/A-18A/B aircraft), or moving the hook handle and the landing gear handle down (F/A-18C/D aircraft). With TANK PRESS or TK PRES LO displayed inflight and either a low fuel state or hot fuel, fuel may boil off and be vented. A high rate of descent may damage the fuel cells. With TK PRES HI displayed inflight, high g maneuvering may result in structural damage.<br><br>. 2.2.2.2 Vent Fuel Caution Display. On aircraft 161249 THRU 161357, the VENT FUEL caution.<br><br>display on the DDI indicates that fuel is in the left and/or right vertical fin vent system.<br><br>. 2.2.2.3 External Tank Pressurization Caution Display. An EXT TANK caution display on the DDI.<br><br>indicates the external tanks are pressurized with the aircraft on the ground.<br><br>. 2.2.3 Internal Transfer.<br><br><br>. 2.2.3.1 Internal Transfer (F/A-18A/B). Normal fuel transfer is accomplished by ejector pumps.<br><br>powered by motive flow. Motive flow pressure is produced by two motive flow/boost pumps, each driven by an airframe mounted accessory drive (AMAD). If an AMAD or pump failure occurs, the other pump produces sufficient motive flow pressure to power all the ejector pumps. The ejector pumps in the internal wing tanks automatically transfer fuel to tanks 1 and 4 when the fuel level control valves in these two tanks open. The ejector pumps in tanks 1 and 4 transfer fuel to tanks 2 and 3 when the jet level sensors in the feed tanks are uncovered, allowing their transfer control valves to open. On aircraft 161925 AND UP AFTER AFC 039, fuel transfer from tanks 1 and 4 is shut off during negative g flight. After tank 1, tank 4 or a wing tank empties, fuel low level floats shut off motive flow to the ejector pump in that tank.<br><br>. 2.2.3.2 Internal Transfer (F/A-18C/D). Normal fuel transfer is accomplished by motive flow.<br><br>powered ejector pumps in the internal wing tanks and turbine-driven pumps in tanks 1 and 4. Motive flow pressure is produced by two motive flow/boost pumps, each driven by an airframe mounted accessory drive (AMAD). Two separate motive flow systems exist, with the right AMAD pump powering the transfer pumps in the right wing and tank 4 and the left AMAD pump powering the transfer pumps in the left wing and tank 1. If an AMAD or motive flow/boost pump failure occurs, a cross-motive valve opens, allowing the good side to power all the transfer pumps. The wings transfer first and transfer is controlled by the feed tank fuel level control valves. The ejector pumps transfer left wing fuel to tank 2 and right wing fuel to tank 3. When tanks 2 and 3 deplete to jet level sensor control range, the turbine-driven pumps in tanks 1 and 4 transfer fuel to tanks 2 and 3 when the sensors are uncovered, allowing the transfer control valves to open. Fuel transfer from tanks 1 and 4 is shut off during negative g flight. After tank 1 or tank 4 empties, fuel low level floats shut off motive flow to the turbine-driven pump in that tank. The ejector pumps do not shut off when the internal wing tanks are empty.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-11.<br><br>

            . 2.2.3.3 Internal Wing Tank Fuel Control Switch. An internal wing tank fuel control switch, labeled.<br><br>INTR WING is on the EXT LT panel.<br>NORM Provides automatic fuel transfer of the internal wing tanks.<br>INHIBIT Electrically closes the wing damage control valve (F/A-18A/B) or the wing motive flow control valves (F/A-18C/D) and the wing refuel level control valves and switches the diverter valves to the feed tank position. The closed wing damage con- trol valve or wing motive flow control valves prevent normal transfer of the inter- nal wing fuel. The closed wing level control valves prevent air refueling of and external transfer to the internal wing tanks. Gravity transfer allows transfer of some wing fuel at a reduced rate and quantity to tank 4. The repositioned diverter valves return recirculated fuel directly to the feed tanks.<br><br>. 2.2.3.4 CG Control. Aircraft 161353 THRU 161519 AFTER AFC 039 AND 161520 AND UP are.<br><br>equipped with a CG control system which automatically controls tank 1 fuel transfer to maintain proper aircraft CG. The system periodically shuts off tank 1 fuel transfer to keep tank 1 and tank 4 properly balanced. CG control operates until the FUEL LO caution comes on, or tank 4 drops below 150 pounds. When tank 4 reaches 150 pounds, tank 1 should indicate:<br>1,350 to 1,700 pounds (F/A-18A) 750 to 1,100 pounds (F/A-18B) 1,375 to 1,550 pounds (F/A-18C) <br>EMPTY (F/A-18D).<br><br>See figure 2-4. Aircraft 161353 THRU 161519 BEFORE AFC 039 are not equipped with a CG control system; refer to figure 11-7 for normal tank 1 and tank 4 fuel levels.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>On aircraft with CG control, if tank 4 fuel transfer fails tank 1 does not transfer fuel until the FUEL LO caution comes on. After the FUEL LO caution comes on, tank 1 transfers fuel to both engine feed tanks until the FUEL LO caution is removed. Tank 1 fuel transfer then remains cyclic until it is empty.<br><br>. 2.2.3.5 CG Caution Display (MC OFP 10A AND UP). On Aircraft 161353 THRU 161519 AFTER AFC.<br><br><br>039 AND 161520 AND UP, a CG caution display indicates that tank 1 and tank 4 fuel is not sequencing.<br><br>properly. CG may be further aft than normal. Refer to Flight Characteristics, Chapter 11. The caution does not come on if the air refueling probe is extended, or the fuel level in tank 4 drops below 450 pounds (F/A-18A/B/C) or 2,800 pounds (F/A-18D).<br><br>. 2.2.3.6 FUEL XFER Caution Display (MC OFP 13C AND UP). A FUEL XFER caution display.<br><br>indicates that tank 1 and tank 4 fuel is not sequencing properly. CG may be further aft than normal.<br>Refer to Flight Characteristics, Chapter 11. The caution does not come on if the air refueling probe is extended, or the fuel level in tank 4 drops below 450 pounds (F/A-18A/B/C) or 2,800 pounds <br>(F/A-18D).<br><br>. 2.2.3.7 Gravity Transfer. If any or all transfer pumps fail, internal fuel transfers by gravity. The flowrate is dependent on the difference in the fuel level between tanks (head pressure) and most of the transfer fuel is available. It may require sideslip to gravity transfer internal wing tank fuel. The wing tank fuel transfers to tank 4 through gravity transfer lines.

            tank 2, respectively, through flapper valves. A nose down attitude may be required to transfer most of the lower portion of tank 4 fuel to tank 3.<br><br>. 2.2.4 External Transfer. External fuel is transferred by conditioned engine bleed air pressure. A.<br><br>single regulator supplies pressurization to all installed external tanks when weight is off the wheels, the air refueling probe is retracted, and in F/A-18A/B aircraft, the HOOK handle is up or in F/A-18C/D aircraft, either the HOOK handle or LDG GEAR handle is UP. Once the external tanks are pressurized, shut-off valves controlled by the external tank fuel control switches provide selection of fuel transfer from either the external wing tanks only, the external centerline tank only or all three external tanks at the same time. All external tanks can be pressurized any time either external tank fuel control switch is in ORIDE (arresting hook handle must be up in F/A-18A/B aircraft). On F/A-18C/D aircraft, selecting ORIDE also overrides any Signal Data Computer (SDC) stop transfer command. With the external tanks pressurized, fuel transfers when the FUEL LO caution is displayed (the air refueling probe must be retracted in F/A-18C/D aircraft), regardless of the position of the external tank fuel control switches.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>On F/A-18C/D aircraft, selecting ORIDE on both EXT TANKS fuel control switches may inhibit centerline tank transfer.<br><br>. 2.2.4.1 External Tank Fuel Control Switches. Two EXT TANKS fuel control switches, labeled.<br><br>WING (for external wing tanks) and CTR (for centerline tank), are on the FUEL panel.<br>NORM With the external tank(s) pressurized, external fuel transfers to any internal tank that accepts it.<br>STOP With the external tank(s) pressurized, external fuel does not transfer until FUEL LO caution display is on.<br>ORIDE Pressurization of and fuel transfer from all installed external tanks is provided (HOOK handle must be up in F/A-18A/B aircraft). The other external tank fuel control switch must be in STOP if fuel transfer from its tank(s) is not desired.<br><br>. 2.2.4.2 External Transfer Caution Display. On F/A-18C/D aircraft, an EXT XFER caution display.<br><br>on the DDI indicates that external fuel is available and should have transferred. The caution is also displayed when external fuel is available at BINGO and FUEL LO.<br><br>. 2.2.5 Fuel Feed System. There are two separate fuel feed systems, one for each engine; however, an.<br><br>interconnecting crossfeed system provides fuel feed to both engines from a single fuel feed system if one system fails. An AMAD driven fuel pump provides pressurized fuel flow to each engine. Each pump is a two-stage pump. One stage supplies fuel to the engine and the other stage supplies high pressure fuel to the motive flow system. On aircraft 161353 THRU 161924 BEFORE AFC 018, each AMAD pump is fed from a separate feed tank by an ejector pump powered by motive flow from the AMAD pump. On aircraft 161353 THRU 161924 AFTER AFC 018, and 161925 AND UP, each AMAD pump is fed from a separate feed tank by a turbo pump powered by motive flow from the AMAD pump.<br>Motive flow from each AMAD pump is also used to cool the accessories on that side of the aircraft and to power the transfer pumps. The left engine is normally fed from tank 2 by the left AMAD pump and the right engine is normally fed from tank 3 by the right AMAD pump.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-13.<br><br>

            . 2.2.5.1 AMAD Pump BOOST LO Caution Display. An L or R BOOST LO caution is displayed on the.<br><br>DDI if the AMAD pump engine feed pressure is lost on that side. With an L or R BOOST LO caution, a normally closed crossfeed valve downstream from the AMAD pumps opens to allow the good AMAD pump to feed both engines at rates sufficient for MIL power.<br>On aircraft 161353 THRU 163118 BEFORE AFC 070 and 161353 THRU 161924 AFTER IAFC 056, the fuel boost pressure switches are removed. Without fuel boost pressure switches, the L or R BOOST LO cautions are inoperative and the crossfeed valve is always open (unless a FIRE light is pressed).<br>. 2.2.5.2 Fuel Feed With Failed Ejector or Turbo Pump. If an ejector or turbo pump fails, fuel gravityfeeds through the inducer inlet to the AMAD driven fuel pump. In this condition, and with high feed tank fuel temperature and high altitude flight, the fuel feed system may not supply enough fuel for the intended power setting but the gravity system provides adequate engine fuel feed for non-afterburner operation.<br>On aircraft without boost pressure switches, the crossfeed valve remains open and both engines are supplied primarily from the feed tank with an operative ejector or turbo boost pump.<br><br>. 2.2.5.3 Fuel Feed With Loss Of Motive Pressure. If motive flow pressure is lost on either side, the.<br><br>interconnect valve between tanks 2 and 3 opens to allow fuel from the tank with the failed pump to gravity transfer to the other tank. The good ejector or turbo pump supplies fuel from both feed tanks to its AMAD pump. Accessory cooling is not available on the inactive side.<br><br>. 2.2.5.4 Negative G Baffles. Negative g baffles in the feed tanks provide limited fuel supply during.<br><br>negative g or inverted flight. No sustained zero g capability is provided. Transition from positive to negative g may cause display of the L and/or R BOOST LO caution(s).<br><br>. 2.2.5.5 APU Fuel Feed. The APU receives its fuel supply from the left engine feed line upstream of.<br><br>the left engine feed shutoff valve.<br><br>. 2.2.5.6 Left and Right Fire Warning Lights. Lifting the guard and pressing either or both fire.<br><br>warning lights electrically closes the corresponding engine feed shutoff valve at the feed tanks, closes the crossfeed valve and arms the corresponding engine fire extinguisher system. The system operates anytime power is on the aircraft or the battery switch is not OFF.<br><br>. 2.2.6 Fuel Recirculation System. The fuel recirculation system cools the AMAD accessories and.<br><br>HYD 1 and 2 hydraulic oil. Part of the engine motive flow fuel passes through an AMAD oil heat exchanger to absorb heat from the AMAD accessories and through a hydraulic oil heat exchanger to cool the hydraulic oil. On aircraft 161520 AND UP and 161353 THRU 161519 after AFC 021, this fuel then passes through a fuel/air heat exchanger to partially dissipate the heat absorbed from the AMAD and HYD oil heat exchangers. This partially cooled fuel then passes through a diverter valve. Fuel from the diverter valve normally goes to the internal wing tanks where it is further cooled. Normally, as long as fuel is being recirculated, there is as much as 200 pounds fuel in the internal wing tanks but may be less (even zero) at high power settings. If the INTR WING switch is in INHIBIT or the FUEL LO caution is displayed (either engine feed tank at or below 800 pounds), the diverter valves direct the fuel into tanks 2 and 3. In F/A-18C/D aircraft, the recirculated fuel is directed to tanks 2 and 3 during idle descent. Also, with weight on the wheels, tanks 1 and 4 not empty and engine inlet fuel temperature above 80°C, the recirculated fuel is directed to tank 4. This improves fuel heat management.<br><br>. 2.2.6.1 Fuel Hot Caution Display. An L or R FUEL HOT caution display on the DDI indicates the.<br><br>designated engine fuel feed temperature exceeds 79°C. Some loss of cooling occurs with the INTR <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-16.<br><br>

            WING switch in INHIBIT. With high ambient temperature and low fuel flow (IDLE rpm) it may be necessary to increase fuel flow to prevent a FUEL HOT display.<br><br>. 2.2.7 Fuel Dump System. All fuel except engine feed tank fuel (and internal wing tank fuel in C/D.<br><br>aircraft) may be dumped by placing the DUMP switch, on the FUEL control panel, to ON. The DUMP switch is spring-loaded to the lever-locked OFF position and is electrically held in the ON position (with the BINGO caution display off, and the FUEL LO light off). Fuel can be dumped at any time by holding the switch ON. With the dump valve open, the ejector or turbo pumps in tanks 1 and 4 force fuel out each vertical fin dump outlet. The internal wing fuel (A/B aircraft) and external fuel (if INHIBIT and STOP are not selected) transfers fuel into tanks 1 and 4, and is then dumped. Dump rate <br>is 600 to 1,000 pounds per minute. Dumping continues until:<br><br>a. OFF is selected on the DUMP switch.<br>b.

On aircraft 163427 AND UP, the INTR WING switch must be set to NORM to ensure adequate fuel dumping. When the right engine is secured, lower dump rates follow immediately and may be accompanied by a CG caution. When the left engine is secured, lower dump rates are experienced as total fuel reaches 6,500 pounds (when tank 4 is empty).<br><br>. 2.2.7.1 Dump Open Caution Display. A DUMP OPEN caution display on the DDI indicates that the.<br><br>fuel dump valve is open with OFF selected.<br><br>. 2.2.8 Fuel Lo Level Indications. The fuel low level indicating system is completely independent of.<br><br>the fuel quantity indicating system. When the fuel level in either feed tank drops to 800 ±100 pounds a FUEL LO light on the caution lights panel comes on which activates the “FUEL LOW” voice alert, a FUEL LO caution display on the DDI appears, and the MASTER CAUTION light comes on. Once activated, the FUEL LO light and caution display remains on for a minimum of 1 minute even though the activation may have been caused by a transient condition.

            . 2.3 FLIGHT PERFORMANCE ADVISORY SYSTEM.<br><br><br>. 2.3.1 Flight Performance Advisory System (FPAS) (F/A-18A Aircraft AFTER AFC 253 OR 292,.<br><br>and F/A-18C/D Aircraft.) The FPAS advises the pilot of the altitude and airspeed corresponding to maximum inflight fuel efficiency based on current operating conditions. The range and airspeed calculated by the FPAS algorithm appears on the FPAS display (figure 2-7). The FPAS display appears when the FPAS option is selected on the SUPT MENU. The FPAS display is divided into five areas: the current range and endurance area, the optimum range and endurance area, the Waypoint/ TACAN steering area, the fuel flow area, and the default area. With engines running and weight on wheels (W on W), only the optimum and default areas are valid. All areas are valid with weight off wheels (W off W). The Waypoint/TACAN steering area is valid with W off W when Waypoint or TACAN steering is selected on the HSI display.<br><br>. 2.3.1.1 FPAS Display.<br><br>. 2.3.1.1.1 Default Area. Temperature, stores drag, and fuel flow parameters, if invalid, do not have afatal impact on FPAS calculations. If one or more of these parameters become invalid, the invalid parameter(s) are displayed in the default area (figure 2-7).<br><br>. 2.3.1.1.2 Current Range Area. The current range area on the FPAS display (figure 2-7) informs the.<br><br>pilot of range to 2,000 lb fuel remaining at current altitude and Mach, the best Mach to fly at the current altitude to maximize range, and range to 2,000 lb fuel flown at that Mach number. If total onboard fuel goes below 2,500 lb the FPAS calculations are done to 0 lb and the TO 2000 LB legend changes to TO 0 LB. If TAS exceeds Mach 0.9 the range at current Mach and altitude is invalid and the word Mach is displayed under RANGE. If the parameters associated with the current range area become invalid the current range area displays XXXX and an FPAS advisory is displayed below the ENDURANCE legend in place of the endurance value. When any of the preconditions is not valid, the range and endurance values display XXXX and an FPAS advisory is displayed. Fuel remaining is monitored and a DDI caution is displayed when calculated fuel remaining on arrival is less than 2,000 pounds.<br><br>. 2.3.1.1.3 Current Endurance Area. The current endurance area of the FPAS display (figure 2-7).<br><br>informs the pilot of endurance to 2,000 lb (0 lb) fuel remaining at current altitude and Mach number, the best Mach to fly at current altitude to maximize endurance, and endurance to 2,000 lb (0 lb if fuel remaining is less than 2,500 lb) fuel at that Mach number. When TAS exceeds Mach 0.9, the endurance at current altitude and Mach number becomes invalid and LIM is displayed under ENDURANCE. If parameters associated with the current endurance area become invalid the current endurance area is Xd out.<br><br>. 2.3.1.1.4 Optimum Range Area. The optimum range area on the FPAS display (figure 2-7) shows.<br><br>the altitude and Mach number at which to fly to achieve maximum range (also displayed) to 2,000 lb (0 lb if fuel remaining is less than 2,500 lb) of fuel. If parameters associated with optimum endurance area become invalid the numerical display area is Xd out.<br><br>. 2.3.1.1.5 Optimum Endurance Area.

The home waypoint is set to 0 at power up.<br>The pilot can increment/decrement the home waypoint, providing FPAS has the ability to calculate the HOME FUEL caution, by using the up/down arrows on the FPAS display. The range for the home waypoint is 0 to 24 (MC OFP 10A AND UP) or 0 to 59 (MC OFP 13C AND UP). The mechanization is circular, in that if waypoint 59 is selected and the up arrow is pressed the home waypoint returns to . 0. The home waypoint must be steady for 5 seconds before the HOME FUEL caution logic can begin.If FPAS cannot calculate the HOME FUEL caution, the home waypoint is X’d out and the up and down arrows are removed from the display. The HOME FUEL caution is not activated if weight is on wheels, the refueling probe is extended, or for 5 seconds after the pilot selects a new home waypoint. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, the HOME FUEL caution resets if: the refueling probe is extended, the aircraft transitions from weight off wheels to weight on wheels, the landing gear is cycled from up to down to up, or the HOME WAYPOINT is changed.<br><br>. 2.3.1.3 FPAS Advisory. The FPAS advisory is displayed on the DDI if the FPAS system loses the.<br><br>capability to calculate the HOME FUEL caution.<br><br>. 2.3.1.4 HSI with Waypoint or TACAN Steering Selected. If waypoint or TACAN steering is selected.<br><br>on the HSI display, the fuel remaining at arrival and the miles from the waypoint or TACAN station to begin descent are displayed on the HSI display. When FPAS cannot calculate fuel remaining and the point to begin descent, invalid Xs are displayed for these parameters. If TAS exceeds Mach 0.9, blanks are displayed.

On aircraft 161925 AND UP, the L or R AMAD PR.<br><br>caution on the DDI indicates that the corresponding AMAD oil pressure is low.<br><br>. 2.4.2 Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). The APU is a small aircraft mounted gas turbine engine used to.<br><br>generate a source of air to power the air turbine starter(s) or to augment the engine bleed air supply to the ECS. It is situated on the underside of the fuselage between the engines, with both intake and exhaust facing downwards. A hydraulic motor powered by the APU accumulator, normally charged by HYD 2B, is used to start the APU. A hand pump may be used to charge the accumulator. The aircraft battery provides electrical power for the APU ignition and start control circuits. The APU uses aircraft fuel.<br>Operation of the APU is automatic after the APU switch, on the left console, is placed to ON. The APU may be shut down at any time by placing the APU switch to OFF.

Either engine may be started first; however, starting the right.<br><br>engine first provides normal hydraulic pressure to the brakes. After the APU READY light is on, place the electrically held engine crank switch to R. This opens the right air turbine starter control valve (ATSCV) and APU air powers the ATS. The ATS in turn cranks the right engine by way of the AMAD gearbox and power transmission shaft. After the right generator comes on the line the engine crank switch automatically returns to OFF. The left engine is started the same way as the right. One minute after the second generator comes on the line the APU shuts down.<br><br>. 2.4.2.3.2 Cross Bleed From First Engine. The first engine should be at a minimum 80% rpm and.<br><br>1,900 pph fuel flow. With the APU off, the engine crank switch controls the ATSCV and the ECS air isolation valve. Placing the engine crank switch to the second engine permits compressor bleed air from the operating engine to pass through the open ECS air isolation valve and the other ATSCV to crank the second engine. After the second generator comes on the line the engine crank switch returns to off and the ECS air isolation valve closes.<br><br>. 2.4.2.3.3 Air Turbine Starter Caution Display.

In the absence of external electrical power, battery power is provided for engine starts, whether using the onboard APU or external air. See Electrical System, figure 2-9 and Foldout Section, for electrical system simplified schematics.<br><br>. 2.5.1 AC Electrical Power. Two ac generators are the primary source of electrical power. The two.<br><br>generators are connected for split bus nonsynchronized operation. This means that with both generators operating each generator supplies power to an independent, isolated aircraft bus. If one generator fails, it drops off the line and power from the remaining generator is automatically provided to the bus of the failed (or turned off) generator. Either generator is capable of supplying power to the entire system. Each generator is activated automatically when its control switch is in the NORM position; and the generator is connected to its buses when voltage and frequency are within prescribed limits (approximately 60% engine rpm). A protection system within the generator converter unit (GCU) protects against damage due to undervoltage, overvoltage, over and under frequency, and feeder faults. If a fault or malfunction occurs, the generator converter unit removes the affected generator from its buses. Except for under speed, the control switch of the affected generator must be cycled to bring the generator back on the line after the fault or out-of-tolerance condition occurs. For an under speed condition, the generator comes back on the line automatically when in-tolerance speed is restored. A generator may be removed from its buses at any time by placing the generator control switch to OFF. On aircraft 162394 AND UP, and 161353 THRU 161987 AFTER AFC 048, in the event that both generators become inoperative due to a bus or equipment fault the bus tie contactors and the ac bus isolation and generator auto reset logic circuit interact isolating the ac buses. Approximately 1 second after the dual outage the logic circuit attempts to reset both generators. If the cause(s) of the dual outage has cleared, both generators come back on line powering their respective buses. If the cause of the outage has not cleared when automatic generator reset is attempted, the generator that normally powers the faulted bus/failed equipment is not restored, and that bus remains unpowered. The other generator comes on line and powers its associated bus and equipment. The ac bus isolation and generator auto reset circuit is prevented from operating whenever the parking brake is set. Beside the parking brake not being set, the generator tie control switch must be in NORM and the battery switch must be ON for the circuit to operate.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-30.<br><br>

The L GEN and R GEN caution lights and the L GEN and R GEN caution displays come on whenever their respective generator drops off the line. On aircraft 162394 AND UP, the GEN TIE caution light advises the pilot that the bus tie contactors are deenergized and the ac buses are isolated. The generator tie control switch, located outboard of the throttles on the left console, allows the pilot to override the ac bus isolation and generator auto reset circuitry and reenable the automatic bus tie ac circuit. These lights operate in conjunction with the MASTER CAUTION.

The output of both transformer-rectifiers are connected in parallel, however, protection is provided so that a short on a bus of one transformer-rectifier does not affect the other transformer-rectifier. If one transformer-rectifier fails, the other transformer-rectifier powers the entire DC system. No cockpit warning of single transformer-rectifier failure is provided. The batteries, designated utility or U battery, and emergency or E battery, are used for engine start when external power or aircraft generator power is not available, and are used to power the essential 24/28 volt dc bus when both transformer-rectifiers are lost. The U battery also powers the maintenance 24/28 volt dc bus when both transformer-rectifiers are inopera- tive. This allows operation of the canopy and maintenance monitor on the ground without any other electrical power on the aircraft. The batteries are controlled by a single battery switch. The system supplies battery power to the essential bus when both transformer-rectifiers are lost and the battery switch is positioned to ON or ORIDE. With the battery switch ON, the essential bus is automatically sequenced between the two batteries. The essential bus and start bus are initially powered by the utility battery, and as the utility battery becomes depleted the essential bus (but not the start bus) transfers to the emergency battery. An ORIDE position is provided on the battery switch to allow selection of the emergency battery in the event the automatic sequencing system fails. In addition, the switch is provided with an OFF position to prevent depletion of the batteries while the aircraft is parked. The batteries charge regardless of the position of the battery switch, providing power is being <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-31.<br><br>

            . 2.5.3 DC Electrical Power (AIRCRAFT 161702 AND UP AND AIRCRAFT 161353 THRU 161528.<br><br>AFTER AFC 049). Two transformer-rectifiers and two 7.5 ampere-hour sealed lead acid batteries with a single battery charger are provided. The transformer-rectifiers are connected in parallel and protection is provided so that a short on a bus of one transformer-rectifier does not affect the other transformer-rectifier. If one transformer-rectifier fails, the other transformer-rectifier powers the entire DC system. No cockpit warning of single transformer-rectifier failure is provided. The batteries, designated utility or U battery, and emergency or E battery, are used for engine starts when external power or aircraft generator power is not available, and are used to power the essential 24/28 volt dc bus when both transformer-rectifiers are lost. The utility battery powers the U BATT/maintenance bus directly which allows operation of the canopy and maintenance monitor on the ground without any other electrical power on the aircraft. In addition, the emergency battery powers the E BATT bus directly. The E/U BATT voltmeter is used to monitor voltage on the U and E batteries. The single battery charger supplies charging power directly to the utility battery and, through the E battery charging contactor, to the E battery. The charger receives power from the right 115 volt ac bus and provides charging power to the U battery whenever ac power is on the aircraft. For the E battery to receive charge, the left 28 volt dc bus must be powered to energize the E battery charging contactor.<br>The batteries are controlled by a single battery switch on the electrical power panel. The system supplies battery power to the essential bus when both transformer-rectifiers are lost and the battery switch is in ON or ORIDE. With the switch ON, the normal flight position, and the left 28 volt dc bus de-energized, the U battery automatically powers the essential and engine start 24/28 volt dc buses.<br>When the U battery depletes to 20.5 volts or below for over 0.5 second, the E battery automatically powers the essential 24/28 volt dc bus (but not the 24/28 volt engine start bus). Placing the battery switch to ORIDE connects the E battery to the essential 24/28 volt dc bus regardless of the status of the left 28 volt dc bus or the U battery. The ORIDE position is provided to allow selection of the E battery if the automatic switching circuits associated with the ON position fail. The OFF position is provided to prevent depletion of the batteries when the aircraft is parked.

            ORIDE Energizes E battery contactor, regardless of status of U battery or left 28 volt dc bus. Position can be used to connect E battery to the essential buses in the event U battery contactor fails to energize. With switch ON only E voltmeter is opera- tive. On aircraft 162394 AND UP, position disables the bus tie circuit and the ac bus isolation and generator auto reset circuit.<br><br>. 2.5.3.2 E/U BATT Voltmeter. The E/U BATT voltmeter, which combines a U battery voltmeter and.<br><br>E battery voltmeter in one indicator, is on the electrical power panel. Voltage is indicated in 1-volt increments from 16 to 20 volts, and in 2-volt increments from 20 to 30 volts. The scales are marked at 24 volts and 20.5 volts (the U battery voltage at which the E battery will automatically power the essential 24/28 volt dc bus). With the battery switch OFF, the voltmeters are inoperative and the indicator needles indicate 16 volts. With the battery switch ON both voltmeters are operative; with the switch in ORIDE only the E voltmeter is operative.<br><br>. 2.5.3.3 BATT SW Caution Light/Display. The BATT SW caution light on the caution lights panel.<br><br>is associated with operation of the batteries. A BATT SW caution display on the DDI (with ac power on the aircraft) and the MASTER CAUTION comes on in conjunction with the caution light. The BATT SW caution alerts the pilot to check the position of the battery switch. The light coming on, on the ground, without ac power on the aircraft indicates that batteries are being depleted and switch should be placed OFF unless APU start is about to be made. The BATT SW light coming on in the air normally indicates that the battery switch is in OFF or ORIDE and should be placed to ON. The BATT SW light coming on in the air with the battery switch in ON indicates that the essential bus is energized by battery power (double generator or double transformer-rectifier failure) and that battery energy should be conserved.<br><br>. 2.5.3.4 Automatic Battery Cutoff. On aircraft 161353 THRU 163118 AFTER AFC 090 and 163119.<br><br>AND UP, an automatic battery cutoff circuit is provided which cuts off the battery from the essential dc bus 5 minutes after internal or external ac power is removed from the aircraft while on the ground with the battery switch in ON. Once the battery cutoff is activated, the battery can be reconnected to the essential dc bus for additional 5-minute periods by either of three procedures: momentarily placing the APU switch ON, cycling the battery switch to OFF then ON, or cycling the MMP enable switch in the nosewheel well to RESET and back to NORM with the battery switch out of the ON position. The automatic battery cutoff circuit has no effect on operation of the ORIDE position of the battery switch.<br><br>. 2.5.4 External Electrical Power. External electrical power may be connected to the aircraft bus.<br><br>system through an external electrical power receptacle on the left side of the forward fuselage. The aircraft buses are energized by external power in the same manner as if a generator were operating. On aircraft 162394 AND UP, the aircraft buses are energized as above provided the battery switch is OFF or the parking brake is set. If the battery switch is ON and the parking brake is not set, the ac buses associated with the right generator are not energized. This condition is indicated by the GEN TIE caution coming on. Some aircraft systems do not energize immediately upon application of external power. Power can be applied to these systems through actuation of ground power switches.<br><br>. 2.5.4.1 External Power Switch. The external power switch, on the ground power panel on the left.<br><br>console (figure 2-10), controls application of external power to the aircraft electrical buses. If the external power is not of the proper quality (within voltage, phase and frequency limits), the external power monitor senses this and disconnects or prevents the external power from being connected to the aircraft.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-36.<br><br>

Each system consists of two hydraulic circuits (circuit A and circuit B). See Hydraulic System, figure 2-11. The two hydraulic systems are identical with the exception of the fluid supply line from the hydraulic system 2 reservoir assembly to the APU hydraulic hand pump. The left, or system 1, provides power to the primary flight control surface actuators exclusively. The right, or system 2, also provides power to the primary flight control actuators and additionally supplies power to the speedbrake and non-flight control actuators.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-41.<br><br>

            Redundancy to the flight control actuators is achieved either by simultaneously pressurizing the actuator from both systems or by supplying pressure to the actuator from one system while the other system is in a back-up mode.<br><br>. 2.7.1 Pumps and Reservoirs. The hydraulic pump for system 1 is mounted on the left AMAD.<br><br>(Airframe Mounted Accessory Drive) and the pump for system 2 is mounted on the right AMAD. The pumps contain a pressure regulating feature which keeps the pump output at approximately 3,000 psi.<br>A pressure relief valve in the filter and pressure relief valve hydraulic unit prevents over pressurization of the hydraulic system and subsystems. A transducer in each reservoir continuously relays system pressure to a hydraulic pressure indicator on the lower right main instrument panel. Each reservoir has a reservoir level sensing (RLS) system which shuts off a leaking branch circuit (HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A, or HYD 2B) when the leak reduces the fluid level below a certain level. When the RLS shuts a branch circuit off and the circuit pressure drops below 1,500 psi, a circuit pressure switch causes the MASTER CAUTION light and the appropriate HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A or HYD 2B caution display on the DDI to come on. The A circuit shuts off when the reservoir level drops to 60% of full.<br>The A circuit comes back on the line and the B circuit shuts off when the reservoir drops to 32% of full.<br>The B circuit comes back on the line and no cautions are displayed when the reservoir level drops below 4% of full.<br><br>. 2.7.2 Hydraulic Circuits. Before the output pressure in each of the two hydraulic systems is routed.<br><br>from the reservoir to subsystems, it is divided into circuit A and circuit B. Each circuit has a circuit shutoff feature to protect the other circuit from depletion due to leakage in the circuit. To prevent fluid loss due to leakage, when the landing gear is up, an isolation valve in both circuit A and circuit B of hydraulic system 2 shuts off pressure to the NWS, launch bar, anti-skid, brakes, and nose gear, as these components are not normally utilized during flight. Circuit 2B isolation can be overridden for inflight recharging of the APU accumulator by holding the hydraulic isolate override switch to HYD ISOL ORIDE. Hydraulic system 2 also has a forward and aft priority valve to monitor demand on portions of the hydraulic system and provide priority for the flight control actuators. If demands on the system are great enough that pressure upstream of the priority valve decreases to approximately 2,200 psi or less, the priority valve completely blocks hydraulic flow through the valve until the demands on the system reach a point that is within the system’s capability to maintain approximately 2,200 psi upstream of the priority valve. There are three hydraulic filter ΔP indicators in each main wheelwell.<br>Two are in the aft outboard corner of the wheelwell and one is in the center of the aft bulkhead. A popped ΔP indicator indicates that the filter is clogged.<br><br>. 2.7.3 Valves. Aft Isolation Valve - The aft isolation valve isolates the APU start, hand pump, APU.<br><br>accumulator, brake accumulator, and the emergency inflight refueling probe actuator from the remainder of the hydraulic system while weight off wheels. This valve is open with weight on wheels.<br>This valve can be opened by the aircrew inflight by the activation of the HYD ISOL switch to ORIDE.<br>This capability allows the APU accumulator to be recharged inflight.<br>Forward Isolation Valve - The forward isolation valve isolates the nose landing gear, launch bar, nosewheel steering, and brakes with the landing gear up and locked. The valve is open when the landing gear handle is lowered.<br>APU Arming Valve - The APU arming valve is activated by rotating and pulling the landing gear handle (emergency gear extension) or moving the probe switch to EMERG EXTD. This allows stored hydraulic pressure in the APU accumulator to be used to emergency extend the inflight refueling probe, emergency landing gear extension, emergency nosewheel steering and emergency brakes.<br>Aft priority Valve - The aft priority valve shuts off hydraulic pressure to the arresting hook retract actuator and speedbrake actuator during high flight control demand.

Two accumulators are provided in the system 2 circuitry, an auxiliary power.<br><br>unit (APU) accumulator and a brake accumulator. Both accumulators can be charged with a hand pump on the ground. In flight the APU accumulator can be charged from circuit 2B by positioning the Hydraulic Isolation Override switch (HYD ISO) to ORIDE. It is recommended that the switch be held in ORIDE for at least 10 seconds to get a full charge.<br>The brake accumulator is continuously charged in flight by a trickle charge restrictor in circuit 2A. The brake accumulator can also be charged in flight by circuit 2B if the HYD ISO switch is positioned to <br>ORIDE and either:<br><br>(a) Emergency landing gear extension is selected or, (b) Emergency IFR probe extension is selected.<br>The APU accumulator serves to start the APU and to provide emergency back-up hydraulic power to refuel probe extension and nosewheel steering. The brake accumulator, in conjunction with the APU accumulator, provides emergency pressure to unlock/lock the landing gear and operate the brakes. A brake accumulator pressure gage is provided on the lower left instrument panel. Another brake accumulator pressure gage is provided in the nose wheelwell. Both gages receive the same signal from a common sensor on the brake accumulator manifold. HYD 2A pressure, through a trickle charge restrictor, compensates the brake accumulator for temperature changes and normal internal leakage when the hydraulic isolate valve is closed.<br><br>. 2.8 FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM.<br><br>. 2.8.1 Application. The flight control system characteristics and mechanization for aircraft describedin this manual varies between aircraft, and may vary on a particular aircraft as a result of various modifications. While changes in characteristics and mechanization may involve structural and mechanical differences, such changes are associated with the particular Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) installed in the flight control computers.<br><br>. 2.8.2 Primary Flight Controls. The primary flight controls are the ailerons, twin rudders,.<br><br>differential/collective leading edge flaps, differential/collective trailing edge flaps and differential/ collective stabilators. See figure 2-12, Flight Control System Functional Diagram. Hydraulic actuators position the control surfaces. Stick and rudder feel are provided by spring cartridges. Although there is no aerodynamic feedback to the stick and rudder pedals, the effect is simulated by flight control computer scheduling of control surface deflection versus pilot input as a function of flight conditions.<br>Normally, inputs to the hydraulic actuators are provided by the two flight control computers (FCC A and FCC B) through the full authority control augmentation system (CAS). A direct electrical link (DEL) automatically backs up the CAS. DEL is normally a digital system but has an analog mode for backup aileron and rudder control. If digital DEL fails, a mechanical link (MECH) automatically provides roll and pitch control through a direct mechanical input from the stick to the stabilator actuators. MECH bypasses both flight control computers and the stabilator actuator servo valves.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-43.<br><br>

            Multiple redundant paths ensure that single failures have no effect and multiple failures have minimum effect on control. Figure 2-12 shows the redundancies and the inputs used to provide the desired flight characteristics.<br><br>. 2.8.2.1 Hydraulic Power. Hydraulic power is supplied by HYD 1 and HYD 2 to all primary flight.<br><br>control actuators (see figure 2-11). Failure of either HYD 1 or HYD 2 does not affect flight control when configured in flaps AUTO (UP), however, failure of either HYD system when configured flaps HALF or flaps FULL may cause an uncommanded yaw and roll transient as the switching valves cycle.<br>The uncommanded yaw and roll may be severe under certain situations such as single engine and high or low speed flight. The uncommanded yaw and roll transient may last three to 6 seconds.<br>Avoid intentional engine shutdown while configured in flaps HALF or FULL. An uncommanded yaw and roll may result when the switching valves switch.<br>The system is arranged to minimize the probability of loss of control to any surface or the loss of control of one surface due to catastrophic damage to the lines or actuator powering any other surface.<br><br>. 2.8.2.2 Pilot Controls.<br><br><br>. 2.8.2.2.1 FLAP Switch. The FLAP switch selects which of the two flight control computer modes.<br><br>(auto flap up or takeoff and land) is active and thus determines the flight characteristics for those conditions.<br>AUTO Flight controls in auto flap up mode.<br>HALF Flight controls in takeoff and land mode below 250 knots. Flight controls in auto flap up mode above 250 knots.<br>FULL Flight controls in takeoff and land mode below 250 knots. Flight controls in auto flap up mode above 250 knots.<br>. 2.8.2.2.2 Control Stick. The stick grip contains the pitch and roll trim switch, sensor control switch,air-to-ground weapon release button, gun/missile trigger, air-to-air weapon select switch, undesignate/ nosewheel steering button and on aircraft 164279 AND UP, the RECCE event mark switch. An autopilot/nosewheel steering disengage switch (paddle switch) is mounted below the stick grip (see figure 2-13). Stick position sensors transmit an electrical signal proportional to stick displacement from neutral to the flight control computers.<br><br>. 2.8.2.2.3 Rudder Pedals. Movement of the rudder pedals transmits a proportional electrical signal.<br><br>to the flight control computers. The rudder pedals are also used for nosewheel steering and brakes. In F/A-18B and F/A-18D aircraft configured as trainers, the rear cockpit pedal input can cancel front cockpit pilot input. In F/A-18D aircraft 163986 AND UP configured for night attack, the rear cockpit rudder pedals are fixed and disconnected from the brakes, rudder, and nosewheel steering.<br><br>. 2.8.2.2.4 Rudder Pedal Adjust Lever. Pressing the rudder pedal adjust lever on the main instrument.<br><br>panel releases the rudder pedals. Both pedals are then forced aft by springs and pushed forward by the pilot to the desired position. Releasing the lever locks the rudder pedals in the new position.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-45.<br><br>

The T/O Trim button is in the center of the rudder trim knob on the.<br><br>FCS panel. With WOW, holding the button pressed drives the roll and yaw trim to the neutral position, stabilator to 12° nose up, and zeros the MECH stick position. When the roll and yaw control surfaces are trimmed to neutral and the stabilator to 12° nose up, the TRIM advisory is displayed on the DDI until the button is released. Actuation of roll trim within 20 seconds of FCS IBIT with wings folded inhibits roll trim. Roll trim is reactivated by pressing the T/O Trim button with WOW.

            . 2.8.2.3 G Limiter. The g limiter prevents exceeding the aircraft positive g limit under most.<br><br>conditions while permitting full symmetrical and unsymmetrical (rolling) maneuvering. The reference for symmetrical pilot commands is the aircraft design load (+7.5 g at 32,357 pounds gross weight).<br>Unsymmetrical pilot command limits are dependent on lateral stick position and vary from the symmetrical limit with small lateral stick displacement to 80% of the symmetrical limit with full lateral stick displacement. A g limiter override feature allows an increase in the command limit g for emergency use.<br>Below 44,000 pounds gross weight, the positive symmetrical command limit is calculated based on fuel state and stores loading. Above 44,000 pounds gross weight, the positive symmetrical command limit is fixed at +5.5 g. The negative symmetrical command limit is fixed at -3.0 g at all gross weights and stores loading. Longitudinal stick displacement required to achieve command limit g varies with airspeed and gross weight. When the command limit g is reached, additional aft stick does not increase g. The positive command limit g is reduced when decelerating through the transonic region. This reduction may be as much as 1.0 g providing the available g is not reduced below +5.0 g.<br>Rapid aft stick movement, with or without g limiter override, commands a very high g-onset rate. This high g-onset rate can cause immediate loss of consciousness without the usual warning symptoms of tunnel vision, greyout, and blackout. Consciousness may not return for more than 20 seconds after the g level is reduced to near 1 g.<br>The g limiter may be overridden by momentarily pressing the paddle switch with the control stick near full aft. Command limit g is then increased by 33%. A G-LIM OVRD caution is displayed and the MASTER CAUTION light and tone come on. A code is stored in the nose wheelwell DDI when the g limiter is overridden. Override is disengaged when the control stick is returned to near neutral.<br>A CG, R-LIM OFF, CAUT DEGD, MC1, or MC2 caution, stores management system failure, FCC/MC mux bus communication failure, or invalid fuel quantity cause the positive symmetrical command limit to be set at 7.5 g regardless of gross weight or stores loading. A G-LIM 7.5 G caution is displayed, the MASTER CAUTION comes on and a “FLIGHT CONTROLS, FLIGHT CON- <br>TROLS” voice warning sounds.<br><br>G overshoot can occur under any flight conditions. G should be continuously monitored. Under the <br>following conditions, g should be carefully monitored:<br><br>. • G-LIM 7.5 g caution displayed. • Positive g with gross weight over 44,000 pounds. • Fuel less than 3,300 pounds. • Negative g with gross weight over 32,357 pounds. • MC1 failure<br>. 2.8.2.4 Actuator Exerciser Mode. An actuator exerciser mode is incorporated to improve cold.<br><br>weather start-up of the FCS. On the ground, the pilot can initiate the exerciser mode by simultaneously holding the FCS BIT consent switch ON and pressing the FCS RESET button. When initiated, the mode cycles the stabilators, flaps, ailerons, and rudders through 20% of full travel for 10 cycles in 20 seconds.

For survivability, one channel from each computer is routed through the upper part of the aircraft and the other channel is routed through the lower part. The stabilator and trailing edge flap servos receive four channel signals from the FCC. The aileron, rudder, and leading edge flap servos receive two channel signals. FCC A is powered by the essential 28 volt dc bus. FCC B is powered by the right 28 volt dc bus. Both computers are normally cooled by avionics air but ram air can be selected for FCC A cooling. The FCCs are provided with separate power inputs which are connected directly to the battery/charger. FCC A is connected to the emergency battery and the FCC B is connected to the utility battery. Should a power interruption occur on the main DC bus, sensors within the flight control computer automatically switch to the backup power source for up to 7 seconds. This ensures the flight control computers have uninterrupted power to maintain full FCES performance during all predictable bus switching transients.<br><br>. 2.8.2.7.1 FCS HOT Caution.

FCS channel 1 and channel 2 (FCC A) circuit breakers are on the.<br><br>left essential circuit breaker panel under the left canopy rail. FCS channels 3 and 4 (FCC B) circuit breakers are on the right essential circuit breaker panel under the right canopy rail.<br><br>. 2.8.2.8 Control Augmentation System (CAS). The longitudinal control system uses air data.<br><br>scheduled pitch rate, normal acceleration (NZ) and angle-of-attack (AOA) to compute stabilator actuator commands. The aircraft response is compared to the pilot command and the stabilator servoactuator is driven to reduce the difference to zero. Since, in the auto flaps up mode, any uncommanded pitch rate or g is reduced to zero, the aircraft is constantly trimmed to steady state hands-off 1 g flight and there is little or no occasion for manual trim. Pitch rate and g (NZ) feedbacks improve pitch characteristics and g control at medium to high airspeeds. Air data scheduled pitch rate feedback improves maneuvering characteristics and provides increasing stick-force-per-g at low to medium airspeeds. AOA feedback provides increasing stick force with increasing AOA above 22°. In the takeoff and land modes, AOA and pitch rate feedbacks are used to augment inherent airframe pitch damping and stability. The computer nulls the difference between the trim AOA and actual AOA. In turns, pitch rate feedback maintains tight pitch attitude control.<br>The lateral control system uses ailerons, differential trailing edge flaps, differential leading edge flaps, differential stabilator, and rudders to achieve the desired roll characteristics. Scheduled air data roll rate feedback is used to augment inherent airframe roll damping. At high airspeeds, aileron travel versus stick movement is reduced and the ailerons do not deflect above 600 knots. Differential stabilator and differential trailing edge flap travel is reduced at high speed to prevent exceeding structural limits. The leading edge flaps deflect differentially up to ±3° when below 30,000 feet and above Mach 0.7. Differential flaps are not used in the takeoff or land modes nor above 10° AOA in the auto flaps up mode. At low airspeeds, aileron and differential stabilator travel are reduced with increasing AOA to minimize adverse yaw. Differential stabilator may also be limited due to a pitch <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-52.<br><br>

            command which has priority. With lateral stick deflection, the rolling-surface-to-rudder interconnect (RSRI) schedules increasing rudder deflection as a function of decreasing airspeed and increasing AOA for roll control, coordination, and to reduce adverse yaw. With wing pylon mounted air-to-ground stores or tanks code set in the armament computer and the rack hooks for those stores closed, maximum roll rate is automatically reduced about 33%. If all stores are shown as HUNG, roll rate limiting is removed; however, an R-LIM OFF caution appears on the DDI.<br>The directional control system uses twin rudders for yaw control. The FCS nulls yaw rate to provide yaw damping. Lateral acceleration feedback (NY) improves turn coordination. RSRI and roll-rate to rudder crossfeed (scheduled with AOA) are used for roll coordination. At low to medium AOA, full rudder pedal deflection provides ½ rudder deflection. At high AOA, the RSRI and rudder-to-rolling surface interconnects combine with rudder pedal inputs to make full rudder deflection available. At high air speeds, rudder deflection is reduced to avoid exceeding structural limits. The control system includes specific logic to improve flying qualities above 20° AOA. Sideslip feedback to the ailerons and differential stabilator improves the resistance to out−of−control flight. Sideslip rate feedback to the ailerons and differential stabilator improves the damping of lateral−directional oscillations. For rolls, the differential stabilator deflects opposite to the intended roll direction to improve roll performance above 35° AOA. A means to temporarily boost roll performance above 30° AOA is provided when lateral stick and pedal are applied in the same direction. Excessive pitch/roll inertial coupling is prevented by giving temporary priority to the pitch axis during simultaneous roll and large pitch inputs. In the takeoff and land modes, rate of change of sideslip feedback augments aerodynamic directional damping and stability. For takeoff or land modes, rudder toe-in is used to improve the longitudinal stability and to provide early rotation during takeoff or bolter. Rudder toe-in/toe-out is a function of AOA with maximum toe-in (30°) at low AOA (less than 2°) or WOW and decreases proportionally thru 0° to 15° toe-out at 11° AOA.<br>. 2.8.2.9 Direct Electrical Link (DEL). A direct electrical link in each axis provides continued electricaloperation of the flight controls after multiple system failures make CAS operation impossible. See FCS Failure Indications and Effects, Chapter 15. In DEL, stability and control is degraded. There are two DEL modes, digital and analog. With any axis in digital DEL, a DEL ON caution is displayed on the . DDI. The FCS reverts to analog roll DEL and analog yaw DEL if there are three digital processorfailures. In addition, the analog roll DEL function is activated if three channels to the aileron are Xd out and the analog yaw DEL function is activated if three channels to the rudder are Xd out. If the aircraft selects analog yaw DEL, the control laws also activate the digital roll DEL function. There is no analog pitch DEL mode. The DEL ON caution is not displayed when in the analog roll DEL mode.<br>The DEL ON caution is displayed when in analog yaw DEL since digital roll DEL has been activated.<br>Extreme caution should be used in analog DEL.

There is no aileron trim capability in analog DEL.<br>Yaw digital DEL provides directional control after three similar yaw rate gyro failures. Rudder displacement versus rudder pedal force is decreased with increasing airspeed. Yaw digital DEL also reverts the roll axis to digital DEL as the roll rate feedback would be destabilizing in this condition.<br>Yaw analog DEL provides rudder control through rudder servo commands without airspeed correction (feel) after three digital processor failures. There is rudder trim in both the digital and analog DEL mode.<br><br>. 2.8.2.10 Mechanical Linkage (MECH). Mechanical linkage provides backup control of the stabila-.<br><br>tors for pitch and roll control. A MECH ON caution is displayed on the DDI. See FCS Failure Indications and Effects, Chapter 15. In the mechanical mode, stick movement directly controls the stabilator actuators bypassing all force sensors, the flight control computers, all air data, all motion feedbacks, servos, and associated electrical wiring. A mode select actuator (ratio changer) increases stabilator movement versus stick movement when the FLAP switch is in HALF or FULL to provide added pitch authority. Pitch trim moves the stick fore and aft, changing the stick neutral point. There is no mechanical lateral trim.<br>In normal flight, the mechanical flight control command (MECH) does not exactly follow the flight control computer commanded position. Stick movement is transmitted to the stabilator actuator through the mechanical system to command a fixed amount of stabilator deflection. The same stick movement transmitted through the flight control computer (FCC) is modified by many inputs to the FCC including: g, airspeed, altitude, pitch/roll rate, trim input, etc., to command a different amount of stabilator deflection.<br>If the aircraft reverts to MECH ON, the stabilator will slowly fade from the flight control computer commanded position into the mechanical system commanded position. The fading takes place at between 1/2° to 1° of stabilator position per second. If the FCC/MECH mismatch is relatively small, the resulting aircraft pitch change is minimal. However, reversion transients have occurred with large mismatches between the FCC commanded and the mechanical system commanded stabilator positions at the time of the reversion to MECH. As the mismatch increases, so does the resulting pitch up or down.<br>As the difference between the FCC commanded position and the mechanical system commanded position is faded out, full stabilator authority is not available. The amount of mismatch is not immediately available to the pilot. Once the mismatch is faded completely out, full mechanical system authority is available. When the fade out is complete, the stabilator actuator responds purely to stick position.<br>Pitch control is less responsive in mechanical system than with the flight control computer. Full aft stick and nose up trim following a MECH reversion does not provide any more stabilator movement than just full aft stick. Trim inputs will relieve some of the spring pressure on the stick while the mismatch fades out giving full mechanical authority.<br>. 2.8.3 Secondary Flight Controls. The secondary flight controls are the collective leading edge flaps,collective trailing edge flaps, drooped ailerons, and speedbrake.<br>. 2.8.4 Flaps. The collective leading edge and trailing edge flaps are controlled as a function of theFCC mode to provide the desired flight characteristics throughout the flight envelope.

The pilot relief mode consists of heading hold, heading select, attitude hold, barometric altitude hold, radar altitude hold, control stick steering (CSS) and coupled steering. The data link mode consists of automatic carrier landing (ACL), precision course direction, and vector approach. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, the coupled steering consists of azimuth steering line couple (ASL), bank angle control (BNK), coupled waypoint steering (WYPT), coupled auto sequential steering (SEQ ( )), and coupled TACAN steering (TCN). Refer to NTRP 3-22.4-FA18A-D NATIP and NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP for ASL and BNK information. Control of the automatic flight control modes is accomplished by the switches on the up front control (UFC), heading set switches on the heading and course set switches panel, and the autopilot disengage/nosewheel steering switch on the control stick (see figure 2-17). Before any mode can be selected bank must be less than or equal to 70°, pitch must be less than or equal to 45°, and the A/P pushbutton must be pressed. Selection of the A/P pushbutton displays the pilot relief options of: ATTH (attitude hold), HSEL (heading select), BALT (barometric altitude hold), RALT (radar altitude hold), and the CPL (coupled steering) option (if available) in the UFC option display windows. When a pilot relief option is selected via the UFC a colon (:) appears in front of the selected display and the selected mode appears on the DDI advisory display. If an option is not available, it is not displayed. When the CPL option is selected on the UFC, the flight controls will couple to that steering mode (in azimuth only). A bank limit, BLIM option, is available on the A/C DATA display. NAV BLIM sets a 30° fixed bank limit. TAC BLIM limits the bank angle between 30° and 60°, based on airspeed. An overfly (OVFLY) option is available on the WYPT DATA display.<br>OVFLY is used during auto sequential steering when it is desired to overfly the waypoint, otherwise the aircraft will turn prior to the waypoint to capture the course to the next waypoint.<br><br>. 2.9.1 AFCS Caution and Advisory Displays.

To establish barometric altitude hold, press the button next to.<br><br>the option display window displaying BALT. The existing barometric altitude at time of engagement is captured and maintained. Heading or attitude hold is maintained, depending upon which mode was previously engaged. The operating range is 0 to 70,000 feet. ATTH, CPL (MC OFP 13C AND UP), or HSEL can be selected with BALT to provide lateral control. CSS causes reversion to heading or attitude hold, depending upon which was previously engaged.<br><br>. 2.9.2.4 Heading Select. To establish heading select mode, select the desired heading on the HSI.<br><br>display by using the heading set switch, located to the left of the center DDI. Press the button next to the option display window displaying HSEL. The aircraft turns from existing heading through the smallest angle to the selected heading. Heading hold is reestablished after the selected heading is captured. Existing pitch attitude is maintained. CSS is available.<br><br>. 2.9.2.5 RADAR Altitude Hold. To establish radar altitude hold, press the pushbutton next to the.<br><br>option display window displaying RALT. Engagement is indicated by a colon appearing in the window next to RALT. The existing radar altitude is maintained upon engagement. Radar altitude hold coverage is from 0 to 5,000 feet. If no other mode is selected, the lateral axis control remains in heading hold. In this configuration, either CSS or the roll trim switch can be utilized with automatic turn coordination up to 45° with altitude maintained. ATTH, CPL (MC OFP 13C AND UP) or HSEL can be selected with RALT to provide lateral control.<br><br>. 2.9.2.6 Coupled Steering (MC OFP 13C AND UP). The coupled steering options are: WYPT, OAP,.<br><br>SEQ#, and TACAN range bearing. To engage coupled steering, the desired steering option must be available and selected on the HSI display, MC1 must be communicating with the FCS, then press the pushbutton next to the UFC option display window displaying CPL. Engagement is indicated by a colon appearing in the window next to CPL and a CPLD advisory on the DDI. The flight controls are coupled (azimuth only) to whatever active steering mode that has been selected (boxed) on the HSI display. Once coupled steering is engaged attitude hold and heading select A/P options are not available. CSS is available in pitch only. Lateral stick displacement greater than 0.5 inch causes the autopilot to decouple from the steering mode. Great circle course can be selected to the fly-to-point, or a selected radial (course line) through the fly-to-point. If course line is selected prior to the fly-to-point, flight controls capture the selected radial, overfly the fly-to-point and continue on the out bound radial. A coupled bank limit option is available on the A/C data display and allows the pilot to select TAC or NAV bank angle limit mode. Selecting NAV limits the bank angle to a maximum of 30°.<br>Selecting TAC limits the bank angle to a maximum of 30° to 60° (depending on airspeed).

            Chapter 24 for detailed navigation steering information under Waypoint/OAP, Auto Sequential, and <br>TACAN Steering.<br><br><br>. 2.10 LANDING SYSTEM.<br><br>The landing system is made up of the landing gear, nosewheel steering, brakes, launch bar, and arresting hook.<br><br>. 2.10.1 Landing Gear System. The landing gear system is electrically controlled and hydraulically.<br><br>operated. The main gear is retracted aft into the fuselage and the nose gear is retracted forward. When the gear is extended, all gear doors remain open.<br><br>. 2.10.1.1 Landing Gear Control Handle. The landing gear is controlled by a two-position, wheel-.<br><br>shaped handle on the lower left side of the main instrument panel. Two conditions must be met before the gear can be raised: the aircraft must sense that weight is off all three landing gear and the launch bar must be retracted. When these conditions are met, the landing gear is raised by moving the handle up. If the launch bar is extended when the handle is raised, the main gear retracts but the nose gear remains extended. When the aircraft senses weight on any of the three landing gear, a mechanical stop in the landing gear control panel extends preventing movement of the handle from DN to UP. Moving the handle down lowers the gear.<br><br>. 2.10.1.2 Down Lock Override Button. The down lock override button is located to the left of the.<br><br>landing gear control handle. If the mechanical stop remains extended after takeoff preventing movement of the handle from DN to UP, a failure has occurred in the landing gear handle down lock circuit. Pressing and holding the DOWN LOCK ORIDE button retracts the mechanical stop from the landing gear control handle allowing it to be moved from DN to UP. The landing gear control handle must be full DN to allow the mechanical stop to properly engage upon landing. If the DOWN LOCK ORIDE button is pressed or the mechanical stop is not fully engaged in the landing gear control handle, the handle can be moved to UP on the ground and the gear will retract.<br><br>. 2.10.1.3 Weight-On-Wheels (WOW) System. Numerous aircraft systems function differently.<br><br>depending upon whether the aircraft is on the ground or is airborne. The most important of these functions include: various flight control laws, landing gear operation, master arm and stores jettison, fuel dump operation, AOA HUD indexers and approach lights, Automatic Throttle Control (ATC) and autopilot operation, pitot static, AOA and total temperature probe heating, fuel tank pressurization, and the inflight IDLE and afterburner lockout throttle stops. To determine when the aircraft is on the ground, a proximity switch on each gear indicates when there is weight on each of the wheels. There are a variety of failure conditions which may result in false indications of WOW or weight off wheels.<br>These include: a misrigged landing gear WOW proximity switch, a WOW proximity switch failure, an improperly serviced landing gear strut, a landing gear control unit failure, or a problem with the aircraft wiring.<br>An uncommanded pitch up after takeoff may occur if a WOW system failure results in the aircraft sensing weight on wheels while inflight.<br>The first indication of the aircraft sensing WOW while inflight is the inability to raise the landing gear handle. Other possible indications include the CHECK TRIM caution, NWS on the HUD, and the CK FLAPS caution if the FLAP switch is moved to AUTO. The aircraft may then quickly undergo an <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-64.<br><br>

            uncommanded pitch up which is caused by the large stabilator deflection present at takeoff. Normally, the stabilator deflection would be trimmed out automatically by the flight control system. As airspeed increases, the uncommanded pitch up rate increases. Maintaining airspeed as slow as practical helps control nose pitch up and assists in lowering the aircraft’s nose. Above 180 knots, full forward stick alone does not stop aircraft nose up rotation, so nose down trim is required to regain control of the aircraft. The FLAP switch should also remain in HALF since the pitch up rate increases if the FLAP switch is moved to AUTO.<br><br>. 2.10.1.4 Landing Gear Warning Lights/Tone. The landing gear warning light is a red light in the.<br><br>gear handle. The light comes on when the gear is in transit and remains on until all three gear are down and locked when DN is selected, or all the gear doors are closed when UP is selected. The light remains on with the gear down and locked if the left or right main landing gear planing link is not locked. When the landing gear handle light has been on for 15 seconds the landing gear aural tone also comes on.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Aircraft equipped with LGCU-01 do not provide an aural tone to the aircrew.<br>In addition, the gear handle light functions as a wheel warning in conjunction with a warning tone.<br>The gear handle light flashes and a continuous rate beeping tone sounds when the gear handle is in the UP position, the aircraft is below 175 knots, altitude is less than 7,500 feet and rate of descent is greater than 250 feet per minute.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>The loss of calibrated airspeed and/or barometric altitude data results in activation of the landing gear handle warning light and tone. First reference the applicable standby airspeed or altitude indicator, then silence the tone.<br>The warning tone may be silenced by pressing the warning tone silence button next to the gear handle.<br><br>. 2.10.1.5 Landing Gear Position/Planing Link Failure Lights. There are three green landing gear.<br><br>position lights marked NOSE, LEFT and RIGHT, above the landing gear control handle. The lights indicate that the gear is down and locked, or that a planing link is not locked. The NOSE gear light comes on steady when the nose gear is down and locked. The LEFT and RIGHT lights come on steady when their respective gear is down and locked and flash if the gear is down and locked but a related planing link is not locked. On F/A-18A/C/D 163146 AND UP; ALSO F/A-18A/B 161353 THRU 163145 AFTER ASC 030, the planing link failure lights is accompanied by a continuous rate beeping tone.<br>Visual inspection does not confirm locked gear, only obvious damage and general position of gear.<br><br>. 2.10.1.6 Emergency Gear Extension. Emergency gear extension is done by rotating the gear handle.<br><br>90° clockwise and pulling (approximately 1.5 inches) to the detent where the handle locks in place.<br>This can be done with the handle in either UP or DN; however, the handle must be rotated 90° before <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-65.<br><br>

            it is pulled. Rotating and pulling the gear handle opens the valves for the emergency landing gear control, the APU accumulator and the emergency brake accumulator. The nose landing gear extends by free fall aided by airloads, and the main landing gear extends by free fall aided by the side brace downlock actuator and the compressed shock absorber. If gear indicates unsafe following emergency extension, it may be the result of the APU accumulator arming valve not opening. Another way to open the APU accumulator arming valve is to emergency extend the IFR probe.<br><br>. 2.10.2 Nosewheel Steering System. The nosewheel steering system is a combination shimmy.<br><br>damper and dual mode steering system. It is electrically controlled by two switches on the stick grip and hydromechanically operated through inputs from the rudder pedals and flight control computers.<br>With the flight control computers operating, momentarily pressing the nosewheel steering button activates and engages nosewheel steering in the low mode (±16°) and NWS is displayed on the HUD.<br>Holding the nosewheel steering button pressed selects the high mode (±75°) and NWS HI is displayed on the HUD. With the wing handle unlocked and nosewheel steering in the low mode, pressing the nosewheel steering button causes the nosewheel steering to go to the high mode where it remains without holding the button pressed. Momentarily pressing the autopilot disengage switch (paddle switch) disengages nosewheel steering until reengaged by the nosewheel steering button. If the launch bar is extended, nosewheel steering is disengaged, however, the low mode may be engaged by pressing and holding the nosewheel steering button. On the ground, nosewheel steering is disengaged when power is removed from the aircraft. Nosewheel steering is also disengaged with weight off the nose gear.<br>During landing, nosewheel steering is automatically engaged in the low mode with weight on the nose gear.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Reversion of NWSHI to NWS (low gain) occurs within 4 to 60 seconds after touchdown due to LGCU BIT.

When failed, the nosewheel steering system reverts to a free swivelling mode.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>With a channel 2 or 4 FCS failure, normal nosewheel steering is lost.<br>Emergency HI gain steering can be regained by pulling the failed channel circuit breaker, unlocking the wings, and pressing the nosewheel steering button. When the emergency HI gain NWS mode is entered, NWS indications may not be displayed on the HUD. If pressing the NWS button results in an FCS caution and single X in the powered channel, emergency HI gain is not available.<br><br>. 2.10.3 Brake System.<br><br><br>. 2.10.3.1 Normal Brake System. The main landing gear wheels have full power brakes operated by.<br><br>toe action on the rudder pedals. An anti-skid system is combined with the normal system to prevent wheel skid. Normal brake pressure is supplied by HYD 2A. The anti-skid system modulates pilot demanded brakes to prevent tire skid.<br><br>. 2.10.3.2 Anti-Skid System. The anti-skid system is electrically controlled by a two position switch.<br><br>on the lower left portion of the instrument panel. The switch is lever-locked to OFF.

            display on the DDI is displayed if the landing gear is down and anti-skid ON is not selected. If anti-skid fails, the DDI displays ANTI SKID as a caution and the MASTER CAUTION light comes on. A touchdown protection circuit prevents brake application on landing until wheel speed is over 50 knots, or if a wet runway delays wheel spin-up, 3 seconds after touchdown. A locked wheel protection circuit releases the brakes if the speed of one main wheel is 40% of the other main wheel. The locked wheel protection circuit is disabled at about 35 knots. The anti-skid system is totally disabled below 10 knots.<br>Anti-skid protection is bypassed when the ANTI SKID switch is off. Normally limited by the anti-skid system, 3,000 psi hydraulic brake pressure is available and regulated only by pilot brake pedal forces. When using brakes at high speed without anti-skid protection, there is a very small margin between effective braking and blown tires. Any force greater than approximately 55 to 60 lbs applied to the pedals (6° to 7° of pedal rotation) will likely result in blown tires with either the ANTI SKID switch OFF or emergency brakes selected. The use of normal (anti-skid off) brakes at high speed should be done with extreme caution. If braking without anti-skid is needed at high speeds, initially apply very light brake pedal pressure and gradually increase as required.<br>Use of brakes without anti-skid at high speed can result in blown tires resulting in loss of directional control. If practical, rollout speed should be as slow as possible before applying brake pedal pressure.<br>ANTI SKID caution does not reappear and brakes may not be available for 13.5 seconds after cycling anti-skid switch inflight or 9.5 seconds during landing rollout, until BIT is completed.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Hot brakes can be expected any time maximum effort braking is used with or without anti-skid at heavy gross weights (e.g., takeoff abort, or heavy landing).<br><br>. 2.10.3.3 Emergency Brake System. The emergency brake system uses normal system brakes with.<br><br>independent hydraulic lines carrying emergency hydraulic pressure to the brake shuttle valve. The system is activated by pulling the emergency/parking brake handle out to the detent. The emergency brake system is powered by the HYD 2B system or the brake accumulator backed up by the APU accumulator. Brake accumulator pressure is shown on a pressure gage on the lower left corner of the main instrument panel and is redlined to indicate pressure below 2,000 psig. However, an indication of 2,000 psig does not mean the onset of degraded braking. It is a warning that there are five full brake applications remaining before BRK ACCUM is displayed on the DDI as a caution and the MASTER CAUTION light comes on. This caution is displayed at 1,750 psi and represents the worst condition (maximum temperature) where the brake accumulator may be empty. When emergency brakes are selected, anti-skid is deactivated even if normal HYD 2A braking is available. No warning/caution is displayed for emergency brake selection. The system is deactivated by pushing the emergency/parking <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-67.<br><br>

The handle must be fully stowed (F/A-18B/D both cockpits) to ensure anti-skid is available.<br>Due to system friction, the emergency parking brake handle may not return to the stowed position without pilot assistance (positive push) during the last part of its travel. If the handle is not fully stowed after selecting emergency brakes, the emergency brake system remains selected. Normal brakes and anti-skid protection cannot be regained until the handle is fully stowed.<br><br>. 2.10.3.3.1 Emergency/Parking Brake Handle. The combination emergency/parking brake handle.<br><br>(figure 2-18) is on the lower left corner of the main instrument panel. The handle is shaped such that EMERG is visible to the pilot when the handle is in the stowed or emergency position and PARK is visible to the pilot when the handle is rotated to the park position.<br><br>. 2.10.3.4 Parking Brake System. The parking brake system uses the same hydraulic lines, accumu-.<br><br>lators and actuation handle as the emergency brake system. The system is activated by rotating the emergency/parking brake handle 90° counterclockwise from the horizontal stowed position and pulling it out to a positive locked position. If the emergency brakes have been activated, it is necessary to reposition the handle to the stowed position then rotate it 90° counterclockwise and pull it to the locked position to select parking brakes. This action applies non-regulated pressure to the disc brakes.<br>With the INS on, the parking brake set, and both throttles above about 80% rpm, the PARK BRK caution and MASTER CAUTION come on. To release the parking brake, rotate the emergency/ parking brake handle 45° counterclockwise from the extended position. This releases the lock and allows the handle to return to the horizontal stowed position.<br><br>. 2.10.4 Launch Bar System. The launch bar is hydraulically extended and retracted by redundant.<br><br>springs. A locking tab mechanically locks the launch bar in the up position. A two position (EXTEND and RETRACT) launch bar switch on the lower left corner of the main instrument panel controls launch bar operation. As the launch bar extends the green L BAR advisory light comes on. When the launch bar is fully extended it is held against the deck by deck load control springs. The control springs allow vertical movement of the launch bar during taxi. As the aircraft is taxied into the launch gear the launch bar drops over the shuttle and is held captive in the extended position as the shuttle is tensioned. On aircraft 161353 THRU 161715, when both throttles are advanced to or above MIL, a throttle switch is made, the green L BAR advisory light goes out and the launch bar switch returns to Figure 2-18.

On aircraft 161716 AND UP, the launch bar switch does not return to RETRACT when both throttles are advanced to MIL or above.<br>The green L BAR advisory light goes out when the switch is placed to RETRACT. If the red L BAR warning light is on with the switch in RETRACT, an electrical fault exists which prevents launch bar retraction after launch. At the completion of the catapult stroke, launch bar/catapult separation occurs and the return springs cause launch bar retraction which allows the landing gear to be retracted. If the launch bar fails to retract after the aircraft is launched, the red L BAR warning light comes on and the nosewheel does not retract. A launch bar circuit breaker is on the left essential circuit breaker panel and when pulled deenergizes the launch bar electrical system.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Failure to place launch bar switch to retract may result in hydraulic seal failure.<br><br>. 2.10.5 Arresting Hook System. The arresting hook system consists of a retract actuator/damper, fail.<br><br>safe manual latch and release, universal hook shank pivot and replaceable hook point. Hook control is a manual system which automatically extends the hook in case of a failure of the release system. The arresting hook handle and hook light are on the lower right main instrument panel. The hook light remains on except when the hook is up and latched or is fully down. Hook extension is a free fall action assisted by a nitrogen charge in the actuator cylinder. Hook motion is dampened laterally by a liquid spring in the hook shank and vertically by the damper in the retract actuator cylinder which minimizes hook bounce and provides hold down force for arresting cable engagement.<br>Without proper N2 pre-charge (insufficient arresting hook snubber pressure), the arresting hook does not fully extend due to HYD 2 backpressure and airloads. If the arresting hook fails to extend as a result of this condition, shutting down the right engine reduces HYD 2 backpressure and allows sufficient extension (35° compared to 56°normal).<br><br>. 2.10.5.1 Arresting Hook Handle. To extend the arresting hook, place the arresting hook handle.<br><br>down. The HOOK light comes on when the hook is in transit and goes out when the hook reaches the selected position. The light remains on if the hook is in contact with the deck and is prevented from reaching the hook down proximity switch. The HOOK light remains on any time the hook position does not agree with the handle position.<br><br>. 2.11 WING FOLD SYSTEM.<br><br>Each outer wing panel is folded upward to a vertical position by a wing fold mechanical/electrical drive. A wing fold unlock flag in the upper surface wing fold area provides a visual indication of the wing lock pins in the unlocked position. The wing lock control and wing fold/spread control are combined in the wing fold handle on the lower right main instrument panel. A wing safety switch is located so that a safety pin can be manually installed from the underside of the wing when absolute prevention of wing fold or spread is desired. The ailerons are locked in neutral when the wings are folded.<br>To avoid damaging the flaps, ensure ailerons are not faired inboard prior to raising the flaps, conducting IBIT, or running FCS exerciser. Proper aileron position can be determined either visually or by verifying an aileron position of 0 or down arrow on the FCS page.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-69.<br><br>

            . 2.11.1 Wing Fold Handle. Normal folding and spreading the wings is accomplished through.<br><br>operation of the wing fold handle. To fold the wings, press the detent on the underside of the wing fold handle, pull out and rotate counterclockwise to FOLD. The MASTER CAUTION light comes on, a WING UNLK display appears on the DDI and the wing fold unlock flag appears. To spread the wings, rotate the wing fold handle clockwise to SPREAD. To lock the wings after they have fully spread, push the handle in. Wait 5 seconds after wings are fully spread before placing the WING FOLD handle to LOCK. When the lock pins are in place the WING UNLK display on the DDI disappears and the wing fold unlock flag is down flush with the top surface of the wing. The wings can be stopped and held in any intermediate position by placing the wing fold handle to HOLD. The ailerons must be faired prior to folding the wings. Normally 115 volts ac operates the wingfold drive unit and hydraulic power fairs the ailerons. However, both of these operations can be accomplished manually. The wings are unlocked by pulling out on the wing fold handle. The drive unit can then be driven with a speed handle through an opening in the lower wing surface just inboard of the trailing edge of the wing fold area.<br>. • Placing the WING FOLD handle to LOCK before the wings are fullyspread removes the WING UNLK caution even though the wings are not fully spread and also causes severe damage to the wing fold transmission.<br>. • With wings folded, verify that both ailerons are Xd out beforeinitiating any IBIT or exerciser mode tests. Lack of X’d out ailerons indicates hydraulic pressure is still being supplied to aileron actuator through a leaking swivel valve. IBIT testing without Xd out ailerons can result in damage to aileron hinge. PBIT BLIN 51 or IBIT BLINs 4263 and 70261 may result following IBIT when wings are folded.<br>These BLIN codes do not require maintenance action prior to flight.<br>However, if BLIN 51 does not reset after airborne, wing-fold function may not be available after landing.<br>. • The wingfold control handle should smoothly go into the LOCKposition. Forcing the handle could cause damage to the wingfold system.<br>. • A 12 minute cool down period is required before cycling wing fold aftertwo cycles maximum, with or without missiles installed. Failure to allow the cool down period may result in overheat damage to wing fold electric drive unit.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. • Do not cycle wingfold handle to FOLD until WING UNLK caution isobserved.<br>. • A cycle is from the spread position to the fold position and down to thespread position.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-70.<br><br>

For instruments that are an integral part of an aircraft system, refer to that system description in this section.<br><br>. 2.12.1 Pitot-Static System. There are two pitot-static tubes mounted under the nose on each side.<br><br>forward of the nosewheel well. Each tube contains one pitot source and two static sources.<br><br>. 2.12.1.1 Pitot Heater Switch. The pitot heater switch on the ECS panel has positions ON and.<br><br><br>AUTO.<br><br>AUTO Heaters are on when airborne.<br>ON Heaters are on when ac power available.<br>. 2.12.1.2 Pitot Pressure. Pitot pressure from the right pitot tube is supplied to the air data computerand the air data sensor channel 2. Pitot pressure from the left pitot tube is supplied to the airspeed indicator and the air data sensor channel 1.<br><br>. 2.12.1.3 Static Pressure. The static sources from each pitot static tube are Td together and this.<br><br>pressure is supplied to the air data computer. The air data sensor channels 1 and 2, on 161520 AND UP, also receive static pressure from this Td static source. On 161353 THRU 161519, channel 1 receives static pressure from the left pitot static tube second source and channel 2 receives static pressure from the right pitot static tube second source. On all aircraft, the standby flight instruments receive static pressure from the left pitot static tube second source when the static source lever is set to NORMAL or from the right pitot static tube second source when set to BACKUP. The static source lever is under the right part of the instrument panel, forward of the right console. With lever in the horizontal position, the selector valve is in NORMAL, with lever in the vertical position, the selector valve is in <br>BACKUP.<br><br><br>. 2.12.1.4 L/R Pitot HT Caution Display. With pitot heater switch in ON or AUTO while airborne, or.<br><br>in ON on the ground; a L PITOT HT and/or R PITOT HT caution display comes on if a malfunction occurs in the heater circuits.<br>Failure of both AOA (ADSU) probe heaters in icing conditions may cause a sharp uncommanded nose down attitude, uncontrollable by normal stick forces or paddle switch actuation. Selection of gain override may regain stabilator control. Care should be used during recovery above 350 <br>KIAS.<br><br><br>. 2.12.2 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator. The standby attitude reference indicator (SARI) is a.<br><br>self-contained electrically driven gyro-horizon type instrument. The right 115 volts ac bus normally powers it. If this power fails, an inverter operating off the essential 28 volts dc bus automatically powers it. An OFF flag appears if both power sources fail or the gyro is caged. Ideally the indicator should be in the caged and locked condition prior to application of power. If power has been applied with the indicator in the uncaged condition, wait at least 30 seconds after power application before caging.<br>During caging the gyro initially cages to 4° pitch and 0° roll regardless of aircraft attitude.

            erect properly. After 3 to 5 minutes, the indicator reads 0° in pitch and 0° in roll. Both readings assume the aircraft is straight and level. Pitch display is limited by mechanical stops at approximately 90° climb and 80° dive. As the aircraft reaches a near vertical orientation, the roll display experiences large rotations. An aircraft wings level attitude in the vertical orientation may result in large errors in either pitch or roll, or both. This is normal, and is not an indication of damage or improper function of the indicator. After completion of vertical maneuvers the indicator most likely requires caging in the normal cruise attitude, to eliminate the errors. Vertical maneuvers with a wing down condition of 7° or more usually do not develop significant gyro errors. A needle and ball are at the bottom of the instrument. A one-needle width turn is 90° per minute.<br><br>. 2.12.3 Standby Airspeed Indicator. The standby airspeed indicator displays airspeed from 60 to 850.<br><br>knots indicated airspeed. It operates directly off left pitot pressure and left static pressure with NORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static pressure with BACKUP selected.<br><br>. 2.12.4 Standby Altimeter. The standby altimeter is a counter-pointer type. The counter drum.<br><br>indicates altitude in thousands of feet from 00 to 99. The long pointer indicates altitude in 50-foot increments with one full revolution each 1,000 feet. A knob and window permit setting the altimeter to the desired barometric setting. This setting is also used by the air data computer. The standby altimeter operates directly off the left static pressure with NORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static pressure with BACKUP selected.<br><br>. 2.12.5 RADAR Altimeter Set (AN/APN-194(V)). The radar altimeter set indicates clearance over.<br><br>land or water from 0 to 5,000 feet. Operation is based on precise measurement of time required for an electromagnetic energy pulse to travel from the aircraft to the ground terrain and return. Voice alert and/or warning tone and visual warnings are activated when the aircraft is at or below a selectable low altitude limit. The set consists of a receiver-transmitter, individual transmitting and receiving antennas, and a height indicator. The receiver-transmitter produces the energy pulses, transmits the energy to the ground, receives the reflected signal and processes this data for display as altitude by the head-up display unit (HUD) and the height indicator. The height indicator, on the instrument panel, consists of a calibrated scale from 0 to 5,000 feet, a push to test switch, a low altitude index pointer, an altitude pointer, an OFF flag, a low altitude warning light, and a BIT light. Other indicators and controls used with the radar altimeter set are the left or right digital display indicators (DDI) (for BIT checks), an altitude switch, UFC, HI/MPCD/AMPCD (for secondary radar low altitude warning), and the head-up display. The energized position of the emission control (EMCON) switch on the upfront control panel inhibits operation of the radar altimeter.<br><br>. 2.12.5.1 Primary Radar Low Altitude Warning. If the landing gear is up and locked and the radar.<br><br>altitude is less than the Low Altitude Limit index, the primary low altitude warning tone/voice alert is heard in the pilot’s headset. With F/A-18A/B before AFC 253 or 292 a ‘‘WARNING, WARNING’’ voice alert is heard. With F/A-18A after AFC 253 or 292 and F/A-18C/D a ‘‘Whoop, Whoop’’ warning tone is heard. The voice alert or warning tone is activated at ground power-up to familiarize the pilot with the warning. When first activated in flight, the warning is continuously repeated until reset or disabled. The warning is reset by setting the low altitude index to an altitude below the present altitude or by climbing to an altitude above the low altitude index setting. The warning can be disabled by <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-72.<br><br>

Once disabled it cannot be triggered until after being reset as described above.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>With an MC1 failure, the voice alert/warning tone is not sounded when the aircraft descends below the altitude set by the low altitude index pointer.<br><br>. 2.12.5.2 Secondary Radar Low Altitude Warning. A secondary radar low altitude warning function.<br><br>is enabled by entering the appropriate altitude, up to a maximum of 5,000 feet on the UFC. The secondary radar low altitude warning provides a single voice alert warning “ALTITUDE, ALTITUDE” when the aircraft descends through the selected altitude. The warning can be disabled by entering zero feet as the stored altitude. Power up with WOW initializes the stored altitude to zero feet. Refer to part <br>VII for information on entering altitude.<br><br><br>. 2.12.5.3 Barometric Low Altitude Warning. A barometric low altitude warning function is enabled.<br><br>by entering the appropriate altitude, up to a maximum of 25,000 feet on the UFC. The barometric low altitude warning provides a single voice alert warning “ALTITUDE, ALTITUDE” when the aircraft descends through the selected altitude. The warning can be disabled by entering zero feet as the stored altitude. Power up with WOW initializes the stored altitude to 5,000 feet. Refer to part VII for information on entering altitude. The barometric low altitude warning function does not affect operation of the radar altimeter low altitude warning function.<br><br>. 2.12.5.4 Controls and Indicators.<br><br><br>. 2.12.5.4.1 Push to Test Switch. Turning this switch clockwise applies power to the set. Further.<br><br>clockwise rotation positions the low altitude index pointer to increasing altitudes. Pushing in on the switch activates the BIT checks.<br>. 2.12.5.4.2 Altitude Pointer. This pointer indicates the altitude of the aircraft from 0 to 5,000 feetabove the terrain.<br><br>. 2.12.5.4.3 Low Altitude Warning Light. This red light comes on to indicate the altitude pointer.<br><br>(aircraft altitude) is below the altitude set with the low altitude index pointer.<br><br>. 2.12.5.4.4 Low Altitude Index Pointer. This pointer sets the altitude at which the low altitude.<br><br>warning light comes on and the voice alert warning is heard.<br><br>. 2.12.5.4.5 BIT Light. This green light comes on during initiated BIT to indicate that the altimeter.<br><br>set is GO.<br>. 2.12.5.4.6 OFF Flag. The OFF flag is in view when the set is off, the pointer indication is unreliable,or the aircraft is more than 5,000 feet above ground level.<br>. 2.12.5.4.7 Altitude Switch. The ALT switch, on the HUD control panel, is used to select either radaraltitude or barometric altitude for display on the HUD and as the primary altitude source for the mission computer. The switch has positions of BARO and RDR. When the switch is set to RDR (radar), the altimeter altitude followed by an R is displayed in the upper right part of the HUD display. If radar altitude becomes invalid, such as the aircraft exceeding the 5,000 feet AGL radar altimeter limit, barometric altitude is displayed and a B next to the altitude flashes to indicate barometric altitude is <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-73.<br><br>

With large angles of bank and radar selected, erroneous altitudes are displayed.<br><br>. 2.12.5.4.8 BIT Checks. Radar altimeter BIT checks shall be initiated from the BIT display. The.<br><br>checks can also be performed using only the altimeter set height indicator. To manually start the normal BIT from the DDI, press the MENU pushbutton to obtain the menu display and then press the BIT pushbutton to obtain the BIT control display. With MC OFP 10A, press the ICS/IBS/RALT pushbutton. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, BIT can be initiated via ALL, AUTO, or NAV from the top level BIT display. At this time the BIT status message on the BIT display reads NOT RDY if the BIT is initiated during radalt time-in. If the BIT is initiated after time-in is completed, the BIT status reads GO indicating the radalt is operating correctly, RESTRT if the BIT is not completed within time limits, or DEGD if a WRA fail signal exists. To BIT check the set using only the height indicator, press the push to test switch.<br>BIT only tests the height indicator and receiver transmitter. The proper installation and function of the antennas are not checked by either BIT method. Aircraft have experienced incorrect radar altimeter readings due to antenna and connection failures.<br><br>. 2.12.6 Standby Rate of Climb Indicator. The standby rate of climb indicator displays vertical speed.<br><br>on a scale from 0 to ±6,000 feet. It operates directly off the left static pressure with NORMAL selected by the static source selector lever or right static pressure with BACKUP selected.<br><br>. 2.12.7 Clock. A standard 8 day clock is installed.<br><br><br>. 2.12.8 Integrated Fuel/Engine Indicator (IFEI) Time Displays (F/A-18 C/D). Two time displays are.<br><br>on the integrated fuel engine indicator below the left DDI. The SDC supplies the time to the IFEI. For aircraft equipped with GPS the SDC time is equal to the GPS time. When the integrated fuel engine indicator is in the normal mode, the upper time display line shows local or zulu time as selected by the ZONE button. The bottom time display shows elapsed time and is controlled by the ET button. The upper time display is a six position liquid crystal display which displays 24 hour time in hours, minutes and seconds. Pressing the ZONE button changes the upper time display to local or zulu. When zulu time is shown, a Z legend appears to the right of the display. The lower time display is a five position liquid crystal (LCD) which displays elapsed time in hours, minutes and seconds.

            . 2.12.9 Standby Magnetic Compass. A conventional aircraft magnetic compass is mounted on the.<br><br>right windshield arch.<br><br>. 2.12.10 Angle-Of-Attack (AOA) Indexer. The AOA indexer (figure 2-19) is mounted to the left of the.<br><br>HUD. It displays approach angle of attack (AOA) with lighted symbols. Corresponding AOA indications are shown on the HUD. The indexer only operates with the landing gear down, W-off-W, a valid ADC AOA signal and a functional ADC. The lighted symbol(s) flash if the arresting hook is up and the hook bypass switch, on the left vertical panel, is in CARRIER. The symbols do not flash with the arresting hook up and the hook bypass switch in FIELD. The switch is solenoid held to FIELD and automatically goes to CARRIER when the arresting hook is lowered or aircraft power is removed. The AOA indexer knob on the HUD controls dimming of the symbols. All symbols light when the lights test switch on the interior lights control panel is held to TEST.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>On aircraft 161353 THRU 161519 without the latest configuration of air data computer installed, a discrepancy exists between optimum approach angle indications provided by the angle-of-attack bracket on the HUD and the angle-of-attack indexer lights. Thus, flying On Speed (velocity vector centered in AOA bracket) on the HUD produces a Slightly Slow indication on the indexer lights. On the other hand, flying On Speed on the indexer lights results in a slightly fast indication by the HUD AOA bracket display. Use of either instrument to set up the optimum approach angle is considered acceptable.<br><br>. 2.13 AVIONICS SUBSYSTEM.<br><br>The avionics subsystem combines the integration and automation needed for one-man operability with the redundancy required to ensure flight safety and mission success. Key features of the system include highly integrated controls and displays; a highly-survivable quad-digital, control-by-wire primary flight control system; inertial navigation set with carrier alignment capability; and extensive built-in test capability. The avionic subsystems operate under the control of two mission computers with primary data transfer between the mission computers and the other avionic equipment via the mux buses.<br><br>. 2.13.1 Mission Computer (MC) System. The mission computer system consists of two digital.<br><br>computers (No. 1 and No. 2) which are high speed, stored program, programmable, general purpose computers with core memory. Computer deselection is made with the MC switch on the MC/HYD ISOL panel. The two mission computers interconnect with the primary avionic equipment via the avionic multiplex (mux) buses. Mission computer No. 1 referred to as the navigation computer, performs processing for navigation, control/display management, aircraft built-in test (BIT), status monitoring operations and backup for mission computer No. 2. MC2, referred to as the weapon delivery computer, performs processing for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attack, tactical control/display, and backup for MC1. On F/A-18A/B aircraft before AFC 225 there are three avionic mux bus channels (figure 2-20) with redundant paths (X and Y) for each channel. On F/A-18A/B aircraft after AFC 225 and some F/A-18C/D aircraft there are five avionic mux bus channels (figure 2-20) with redundant paths (X and Y) for each channel. Channel 1 links the mission computers and the flight control computers, air data computer, control converter (communication system control), armament control- processor set (stores management set), signal data computer (F/A-18C/D), HARM command launch computer, left digital display indicator, and one comm radio.

Mission Data can be manually loaded.<br><br>into the mission computer through the Memory Unit Mission Initialization (MUMI) display or can be automatically loaded. F/A-18A aircraft after AFC 253 or 292 the Mission Data Loader (MDL) is used to automatically load and store data. In F/A-18C/D aircraft, the Data Storage Set (DSS) is used to automatically load data. The DSS consists of the Memory Unit (MU) and the Memory Unit Mount (MUM) and provides memory storage for aircraft parameters, maintenance data, and avionic initialization data. The DSS receives, stores, retrieves, and transmits data with the mission computer.<br><br>. 2.13.1.2.1 Mission Initialization. The MDL, or MU provides the capability to load the following.<br><br>mission initialization files: HARM, MU ID, RADAR, RECCE, TACAN, WYPT/OAP, sequential steering, data link/ID, overlay controlled stores (OCS), with MC OFP 13C AND UP, bomb wind data, (with aircraft equipped with GPS) global positioning system waypoint (GPS WYPT), global position- ing system almanac (GPS ALM), and Fighter Link Reference Point (FLRP). On aircraft 163427 AND UP AFTER AFC 270, COMM DCS initialization files can be loaded. Automatic loading is done at aircraft power up or when MUX communication is lost for more than 1 second and regained. If MUX communication is not regained, an MU LOAD caution is displayed and an AV MUX error message is displayed on the MUMI display. Manual loading may be done using the MUMI display.<br><br>. 2.13.1.2.2 Memory Unit Mission Initialization (MUMI) Display. The MUMI display (see figure.<br><br>2-21) is accessible from the SUPT MENU and with WOW provides a visual indication of mission initialization files loaded from the MU/MDL. If the MU directory indicates that no user files are present, the MU ID displays NO IDENT. When the MU directory indicates a user file is present, MC 1 displays the option at the applicable pushbutton (with MC OFP 13C AND UP, MORE provides additional transfer options for weapons and DCS). When the pushbutton is pressed and the file is being read by MC 1, the option is boxed. If the read is successful, the file is loaded and the option is unboxed.<br>When a file is present and errors have resulted from reading the file, the following occurs:<br>. 1.

            . 2.13.1.2.4 Erase and Hold Data. The erase controller (EC) within MC 1 provides the capability to.<br><br>automatically and manually erase or inhibit erasing of classified data contained in the MU/MDL, armament computer, and MC 1 and MC 2. When the EC determines classified mission initialization files have been read from the MU/MDL, the EC classified data management system is activated. When <br>activated and aircraft is WOW, MC 1:<br><br>. 1. Displays HOLD, ERASE, and MC suspends option on the MUMI display.. 2. Displays CDATA advisory.. 3. Sends applicable maintenance code to SDC.<br>. 2.13.1.2.5 Automatic Erase. The MU/MDL, armament computer, MC 1, and MC 2 are automati-.<br><br><br>cally erased when all of the following criteria are met:<br><br>. 1. Airspeed is less than 50 KIAS.. 2. Left and right engine power lever angle is less than 29°.. 3. Weight on wheels.. 4. Pilot does not select erase inhibit (HOLD) or MC SUSPEND options.Automatic erase is also initiated by pilot ejection.<br>Automatic erase can be inhibited by selecting the HOLD pushbutton option.<br>. 1. HOLD boxed with MU displayed prevents automatic erase of the MU.. 2. HOLD boxed with ALL displayed prevents automatic erase of all units (MU/MDL, armamentcomputer, and MC 1 and MC 2).<br>The EC commands the MU/MDL, the armament computer, MC 1, then MC 2 to erase. The MC ERASE IN XX SEC countdown timer starts (60 seconds). During the countdown the MC SUSPEND pushbutton option cycles between boxed and unboxed. When the timer reaches zero, the decision to continue erasing the remainder of MC 1 and MC 2 depends on the MC SUSPEND pushbutton being deselected (unboxed). When deselected, the remaining erase of MC 1 and MC 2 is completed.<br><br>. 2.13.1.2.6 Manual Erase. Manual erase is initiated by pressing the ERASE pushbutton on the.<br><br>MUMI display. When pressed, ERASE is boxed and erasing proceeds the same as automatic erase.<br>When erasing is complete, the ERASE pushbutton is unboxed. While erase is in progress one of the <br>following is displayed on the MUMI display:<br><br>. 1. ERASING - erasing of unit is in progress.. 2. COMPLETE - erasing of unit is complete.. 3. FAILED - unit failed to erase.When erase fails the MC 1 retains the MUMI ERASE and HOLD pushbutton options and displays the ERASE FAIL caution on the DDI. When erasing is complete MC 1 removes the ERASE, HOLD, and MC SUSPEND pushbutton options from the MUMI display, removes the CDATA advisory from the display, and resets the applicable maintenance code(s).<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-86.<br><br>

Placing the switch to 2 OFF turns off digital computer No. 2. With the switch set to NORM, both No. 1 and No. 2 digital computers are turned on.<br><br>. 2.13.2 Master Modes. There are three master modes of operation: navigation (NAV), air-to-air.<br><br>(A/A), and air-to-ground (A/G). The controls, displays, and the avionic equipment operation are tailored as a function of the master mode which the pilot has selected. The navigation master mode is entered automatically when power is applied to the aircraft, when the air-to-air or air-to-ground modes are deselected, when the landing gear is lowered, when the SPIN mode activates, or when the aircraft has weight on wheels and the throttle position (power lever angle) is greater than 56°. The A/A master mode is entered either by pressing the A/A master mode button alongside the left DDI or by selecting an A/A weapon with the A/A weapon select switch on the control stick. The A/G master mode is selected by pressing the A/G master mode button. The selection is performed by the stores management set (SMS), and the SMS identifies the selected master mode to the mission computer.<br><br>. 2.13.2.1 Steering Information. The sources of steering information available in the NAV master.<br><br>mode are waypoint, TACAN, instrument landing system and data link. The data link modes available in the NAV master mode are vector and automatic carrier landing. TACAN and waypoint steering are mutually exclusive and selecting one automatically deselects the other. However, data link, ILS, and TACAN (or waypoint) steering can be provided simultaneously. The ACL mode is selectable only in the NAV master mode, and the vector mode is available in all master modes. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, steering information is used by the Automatic Flight Control System to provide coupled steering options.<br><br>. 2.13.3 Cockpit Controls and Displays. The cockpit controls and displays which are used for.<br><br>navigation operation are on the multipurpose display group and on the upfront control (UFC).<br><br>. 2.13.4 Multipurpose Display Group.

The multipurpose display group presents navigation, attack, and aircraft attitude displays to the pilot. The multipurpose display group converts information received from the mission computer system to symbology for display on the right and left DDIs, the HI/MPCD, and the HUD. The HUD camera records the outside world and HUD symbology. The left and right DDIs and the HI/MPCD contain pushbuttons for display selection and various equipment operating modes. Refer to Part VII for the operation of each component.<br><br>. 2.13.4.1 Digital Display Indicators (DDI). The right and left DDIs are physically and functionally.<br><br>interchangeable giving the ability to display desired information on either indicator or using either indicator to control the HUD or horizontal indicator displays. The left indicator is used primarily for stores status, built-in test status, engine monitor, caution, and advisory displays. The right indicator is normally used for radar and weapon video displays.<br>On aircraft 163985 AND UP the DDIs are NVG compatible and display three colors (red, yellow, and green) for stroke information.

            . 2.13.4.3 Electronic Attitude Display Indicator (EADI). The electronic attitude display indicator is.<br><br>available for display on the left or right DDI as an alternative to the attitude display on the HUD (figure 2-23). A small circle is displayed on the ball to represent the zenith and a circle with an inscribed cross is displayed to represent the nadir. The pitch ladder is displayed in 20° increments with MC OFP 10A AND UP, or 10° increments with MC OFP 13C AND UP. A turn indicator which displays FCS yaw rate is provided below the ball. A standard rate turn (3° per second) is indicated when the lower box is displaced so that it is under one of the end boxes. The EADI display is selected by pressing the ADI pushbutton on the MENU.<br>Selecting the INS or STBY options at the bottom of the display determines the source of attitude information used to generate the display. Upon power-up with WOW, the EADI attitude initializes to STBY (STBY boxed), thus using the standby attitude reference indicator for attitude source information. With STBY boxed the EADI display should be compared to the visual display on the standby altitude reference indicator. If the pitch and roll attitude display does not correlate on the two instruments, the standby indicator is most likely defective, requiring maintenance. Selecting the INS option (INS boxed) uses attitude information provided by the INS. Selection of the INS or STBY on the EADI does not change the source of attitude data for the HUD.<br>With MC OFP 13C AND UP, airspeed and altitude are displayed in a box at the top left and altitude source is displayed to the right of the altitude box and the vertical velocity is displayed above the altitude box.

            . 2.13.4.4.1 Mode Selector Knob. The mode selector knob has positions of DATA, N-UP, NORM,.<br><br>and D-CTR. Placing the knob to DATA selects the index frame of the moving map display and enables the upfront control for entering the desired data frame number. The index provides a listing of data available on each frame. After a data frame has been selected the film can be stepped to adjacent frames by using the up arrow and down arrow pushbuttons on the HI. Selecting N-UP on the mode selector knob rotates the map to true north up. The lubber line remains on the aircraft’s magnetic heading and the ground track is magnetic ground track. Placing the knob to NORM position selects track-up display. The compass rose is rotated to aircraft magnetic ground track. The aircraft symbol and the lubber line are at the aircraft magnetic heading. With the mode selector knob in D-CTR, decentered track-up display is selected with the aircraft symbol at the bottom of the display. The aircraft symbol and the lubber lines are at the aircraft magnetic heading. When the decentered mode is selected, the range scale at top center is doubled to indicate 20, 40, 80, 160, or 320, although the actual scale is unchanged. The reason for this is that the scale number is the distance from the aircraft symbol to the inside of the compass rose. In the decentered mode, the projected map is displayed when the scale indicates 20 and 80 miles.<br><br>. 2.13.4.4.2 HI Brightness Selector Knob. The knob has positions of OFF, NIGHT, and DAY.<br><br>Placing the knob to OFF prevents the indicator from operating. Placing the knob to NIGHT provides a lower brightness control range. The knob in the DAY position provides higher brightness control range.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. • If the knob is in NIGHT position and the map filter is out of view oronly partially in view, switch the knob to DAY for 2 seconds and then back to NIGHT. If the knob is in DAY position and the map filter is in view or partially in view, switch the knob to NIGHT for 2 seconds then back to DAY. If the knob is set to OFF and the DAY position is desired, switch from OFF to DAY in less then 0.5 second.<br>. • To prevent damage to the moving map servos, keep the HI brightnessselector knob in NIGHT or DAY and at least one DDI on whenever the aircraft is in motion.<br><br>. 2.13.4.4.3 Slew Pushbutton. Pressing the slew pushbutton on the HI assigns the TDC to the HI.<br><br>map for slewing. The map slew function is used for position updating and waypoint entry as well as to look at off-scale regions of the map. The word SLEW is displayed in the upper right corner of the HI while the TDC is assigned to the HI for map slewing.<br>When the TDC is pressed to slew the map (other than for a map position update or waypoint/OAP data entry), the following symbology is removed from the HI: TACAN symbol, waypoint/OAP symbol along with their respective bearing pointers and tails. The aircraft symbol is replaced with an X indicating the slew point. When slewing is completed the map freezes.

            . 2.13.4.7 HSI Display Symbology. Basic HSI symbology such as the compass rose, ground track.<br><br>pointer, lubber line (for magnetic heading), true airspeed readout, ADF bearing pointer, groundspeed readout, and aircraft symbol are not described, however, they are shown in figure 2-24. The radar target and GEO REF symbols are described in NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP. The following paragraphs describe unique F/A-18 navigation symbology (figure 2-24). Refer to part VII for a description of how these symbols are integrated in with the navigation system.<br>. 1. Waypoint/OAP data. Data for the current steer to waypoint/OAP is displayed on the upper rightcorner of the HSI. Waypoint/OAP data consists of bearing, range, and TTG (time-to-go) up to 8:59:59 based on distance and ground speed. When a waypoint/OAP or offset to the OAP is designated (becomes a target), this data then relates to the target. When a waypoint is a waypoint that is transferred from GPS, an ID Code is displayed under the waypoint data. When GPS is coupled to the INS, an ID Code is displayed under the waypoint data.<br>. 2. TACAN data. TACAN data is displayed on the upper left corner of the HSI. TACAN dataconsists of bearing, range (slant range), TTG (based on distance and present ground speed), and the station identifier.<br>. 3. Waypoint/OAP symbology. Waypoint/OAP symbology consists of a waypoint/OAP symbol,bearing pointer and tail. The waypoint/OAP symbol indicates the position of the selected waypoint/OAP relative to the aircraft symbol. The waypoint/OAP bearing pointer and tail are displayed inside the compass rose and indicate bearing to the selected waypoint/OAP. Waypoint/ OAP symbology is displayed whether or not waypoint/OAP steering is selected. When the selected waypoint/OAP is outside the HSI range scale, the waypoint/OAP symbol is limited at the inside of the compass rose coincident with the pointer. When a waypoint/OAP is designated, the waypoint/OAP symbol and circle inside the pointer change to a diamond shape. The offset symbol appears when steering is to an OAP. The offset symbol indicates the position of the offset relative to the OAP.<br>. 4. TACAN symbology. TACAN symbology consists of a TACAN symbol, TACAN bearing pointerand tail. The TACAN symbol indicates the position of the TACAN station relative to the aircraft symbol. The TACAN bearing pointer and tail are located outside of the compass rose and indicate bearing to the TACAN station. When the TACAN station is outside the HSI range scale, the TACAN symbol is limited at the inside of the compass rose. When TACAN range becomes invalid the TACAN symbol is not displayed.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>TACAN symbology displayed inside of the compass rose is filtered to prevent excessive movement of TACAN symbols due to RF interference. However, the ″fly−to″ needle displayed in the HUD with TACAN steering selected is not filtered and represents the raw data received by the TACAN. As a result, for brief periods of time, the HUD and HSI may display conflicting information regarding aircraft position with respect to the selected TACAN course line. Aircrew should use HUD displayed TACAN information when conducting <br>TACAN approaches.<br><br>. 5. Heading select marker and readout. The heading select marker is maneuvered along theperiphery of the compass rose using the HDG switch.

            is located on the lower left corner of the HSI. The heading select marker and digital readout are <br>part of the heading select mode of the autopilot.<br><br>. 6. Course line arrow and readout. The course line arrow indicates the selected course to thewaypoint/OAP or TACAN station. The course is selected using the CRS switch. The digital readout of the selected course is displayed on the lower right corner of the HSI. The course line arrow is not displayed when TACAN range is invalid. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, the perpendicular distance to the nearest 0.1 nm (up to a maximum of 99.9 nm) followed by C is displayed above the CSEL display. If a sequence is displayed with AUTO boxed and the current steer-to waypoint selected, then perpendicular distance to the sequence line is displayed as described above, but followed by S.<br>. 7. TDC assignment diamond. The TDC assignment diamond is displayed on the upper right cornerof the HSI. This diamond indicates that the TDC is assigned to the HSI. In aircraft 163986 AND UP the TDC assignment diamond indicates control is assigned to both cockpits. Other symbols indicate front or aft cockpit TDC control and corresponding SLEW control options by actuating the sensor control switch AFT, while in the NAV or A/G master mode. The word SLEW is displayed in the TDC assignment diamond position when the SLEW pushbutton is pressed.<br>. 8. Coupled steering symbology. CPL and the source of the steering information is displayed oneither side of the aircraft symbol in the center of the HSI display whenever the flight control system is coupled in azimuth to a steering source. Steering source can be WYPT, TCN, or SEQ#.<br>The couple cue flashes for 10 seconds and then is removed if the steering signal is lost or becomes invalid.<br>. 9. Sequential steering lines. The sequential steering lines are displayed when a sequence is enteredand when one of the sequence options (SEQ1, SEQ2, or SEQ3) is boxed. The sequential steering lines are available for display in all HSI modes and range scales. Sequential steering lines are not displayed at power up with WOW and are removed when magnetic heading is invalid, aircraft position is invalid, or map slew is selected.<br>. 10. Zulu time of day (ZTOD). ZTOD is displayed on the lower left corner of the HSI. For F/A-18A/Baircraft ZTOD must be set in order to be displayed. For F/A-18C/D aircraft that pass the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT, ZTOD does not need to be entered. For F/A-18C/D aircraft that do not pass the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT, ZTOD must be entered.<br>. 11. Groundspeed required. Groundspeed required appears below the current groundspeed readout.Groundspeed required indicates the groundspeed required to a target based on entered ZTOD, time on target (TOT), and the target.<br>. 12. Elapsed time (ET)/countdown (CD) time. ET and CD time are displayed on the lower rightcorner of the HSI. However, only one of the timers can be displayed at a time. Either ET or CD timer must be selected to be displayed. ET initializes to zero minutes and seconds and CD time initializes to six minutes and zero seconds.<br>. 13. Aircraft heading. Aircraft heading is indicated on the compass rose. Aircraft heading and bearingdata can be selected as either magnetic or true. With true heading selected, the letter T appears below the lubber line and the word TRUE appears below the selected scale readout. There is no indication when magnetic heading is selected.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-96.<br><br>

            . 2.13.4.8 Head-Up Display (HUD). The HUD is on the center main instrument panel. The HUD is.<br><br>used as the primary flight instruments, weapon status, and weapon delivery display for the aircraft under all selected conditions. The HUD receives attack, navigation, situation, and steering control information from the left or right DDI symbol generators (under mission computer control), and projects symbology on the combining glass for head-up viewing. The HUD is electrically interfaced with the UFC. On aircraft 163985 AND UP the HUD has been enhanced by adding NVG compatible raster display capability so as to allow it to display NFLR video. The most visible change to the HUD can be noticed on the HUD control panel (figure 2-25) below the UFC.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.1 HUD Symbology Reject Switch. This three-position toggle switch has positions of.<br><br>NORM, REJ 1, and REJ 2. With the switch placed to NORM, the normal amount of symbology is provided for all HUD displays. Placing the switch to REJ 1 removes aircraft mach number, aircraft g’s, bank angle and pointer, airspeed box, altitude box, peak positive g, and required ground speed cue from the HUD. Placing the switch to REJ 2 removes all REJ 1 symbology plus the heading scale, current heading indication (caret/T), command heading marker, NAV/TACAN range, and the ET, CD, or <br>ZTOD timer.<br><br><br>. 2.13.4.8.2 HUD Symbology Brightness Control. This knob is used to turn on the HUD and then.<br><br>varies the display intensity.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.3 HUD Symbology Brightness Selector Knob. This is a three-position toggle switch with.<br><br>positions of DAY, AUTO, and NIGHT. Placing the switch to DAY provides maximum symbol brightness in conjunction with the HUD symbology brightness control. Placing the switch to AUTO allows automatic control of the contrast by the automatic brightness control circuit. On aircraft 163985 AND UP the AUTO position is deleted. With the switch set to NIGHT, a reduced symbol brightness is provided in conjunction with the HUD symbology brightness control.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.4 HUD Video Control Switch (Aircraft 163985 AND UP). The video control switch is a.<br><br>three-position switch with positions of OFF, VID, and W/B. The video control switch enables NFLR video to be displayed on the HUD with selectable polarity (white hot/black hot).<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.5 Black Level Control (Aircraft 163985 AND UP).

This knob controls the brightness of the indexer lights.<br><br><br>. 2.13.4.8.8 Altitude Switch. This is a two-position toggle switch with positions of BARO and RDR.<br><br>This switch is used to select either radar altitude (RDR) or barometric altitude (BARO) for display on the HUD, and as the primary altitude source for the mission computer.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.9 Attitude Selector Switch. This three-position toggle switch has positions of INS, AUTO,.<br><br>and STBY. Placing the switch to AUTO or INS selects filtered INS data as the primary source of attitude information. With the ASN-130 installed, the INS automatically reverts to attitude heading reference system (AHRS) using unfiltered data if its processor fails. The mission computer automati- cally selects the standby attitude reference indicator for attitude information if the INS fails completely. Placing the switch to STBY selects the standby attitude reference indicator as the source of attitude information for the mission computer and displays. With the FCCs no longer receiving INS data, Xs are set in CH 1/3 of PROC row on the FCS page. With the ASN-139 or EGI installed, the INS automatically reverts to the standby attitude reference indicator. With the ASN-139 or EGI installed, a partial alignment may result in the gyro mode of the INS/EGI being activated. Selecting the attitude source on the EADI does not change the source of attitude data for the HUD.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.10 Fault Indicator. The indicator displays unit operational status: white for failed and.<br><br>black for normal.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.11 HUD Symbology. The following paragraphs describe HUD symbology as related to basic.<br><br>navigation, steering (direct great circle, courseline, and ILS), navigation target designation, advisories and landing, see figure 2-26. Refer to part VII for a description of how these symbols are integrated into the navigation system. Also, refer to part VII for unique ACL data link symbology. Refer to NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIPand NTRP 3-22.4-FA18A-D NATIP for symbology concerning the A/A and A/G master modes, weapons, RWR and the data link vector mode.<br>. 1. Heading. The aircraft magnetic/true heading is indicated by the moving 30° heading scale. Theactual aircraft heading is directly above the caret/T symbol. The moving heading scale provides trend information during turns. As the aircraft turns right, the scale moves from right to left.<br>Magnetic or true heading may be selected. Magnetic heading is indicated by a caret below the heading scale. True heading selection is indicated by a T appearing below the current heading.<br>. 2. Airspeed. Calibrated airspeed from the air data computer is provided in the box on the left sideof the HUD. The tops of the airspeed and altitude boxes are positioned at the aircraft waterline (4° up from the optical center of the HUD).<br>. 3. Altitude. The altitude presented in the box on the right side of the HUD may be either barometricaltitude or radar altitude depending on the setting of the altitude switch on the HUD control panel. When the altitude switch is in BARO , barometric altitude is displayed. When the altitude switch is in RDR , radar altitude is displayed and is identified by an R next to the altitude. If the radar altitude is invalid, barometric altitude is displayed and a B next to the altitude flashes to indicate that barometric altitude is being displayed rather than radar altitude. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, an X displayed next to the barometric altitude indicates that the altitude value may be inaccurate. The thousand and ten thousand digits are 150% size numbers. The hundred, ten, and unit digits are 120% size numbers, except that below 1,000 feet they are 150% size.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-101.<br><br>

            . 4. Barometric setting. The barometric setting used by the air data computer (ADC) is the value setin the standby altimeter. When the barometer setting is changed on the standby altimeter, the ADC barometric setting is presented below the altitude on the HUD to provide a head-up baro-set capability. The display remains for 5 seconds after the change is made. In addition, the baro-set value is displayed and flashed for 5 seconds when the aircraft descends below 10,000 feet at an airspeed less than 300 knots.<br>. 5. Angle of attack. True angle of attack in degrees is displayed at the left center of the HUD. Theprimary source for this information is the ADC. If the ADC produces invalid AOA outputs, the MC uses FCC information to derive the AOA display. There is no pilot queuing when the MC switches AOA sources from ADC to FCC because both components get AOA information from the AOA probes. For lower AOA values, HUD AOA is an average of the AOA probe readings received by the ADC. Above 34° AOA, HUD AOA is estimated and provided by the INS.<br>. 6. Mach number. The aircraft mach number is displayed immediately below the angle of attack.. 7. Aircraft g. Normal acceleration of the aircraft is displayed immediately below the Mach number.. 8. Peak aircraft g. A peak positive g indication is displayed on the HUD below the normal g anytimea threshold of 4.0 g is exceeded. The peak positive g display can be removed by cycling the clutter reject switch to one of the reject positions.<br>. 9. Bank angle scale. A bank angle scale and pointer are displayed at the bottom of the HUD for bankangle reference up to 45°. At bank angles in excess of 47°, the bank angle scale pointer is limited at 45° and flashed.<br>. 10. Velocity vector. The velocity vector provides the pilot with an outside world reference withregard to actual aircraft flight path. The velocity vector represents the point towards which the aircraft is flying (aircraft flight path). The position of the velocity vector is limited to an 8° radius circle centered at the HUD optical center. If the velocity vector reaches this limit during high angle of attack flight or large yaw and/or drift angles, then it flashes rapidly to indicate that it does not accurately indicate flight path. With GPS or EGI installed, if the INS velocity data becomes unreliable, the mission computer utilizes the GPS information. If INS velocity data becomes unreliable the mission computer utilizes air data computer information and the last available wind data to compute the velocity vector and this degraded velocity vector is indicated by a slow flashing of the symbol. In the NAV master mode, the velocity vector may be caged to the vertical center line of the HUD by the cage/uncage switch on the throttle. When it is caged, a ghost velocity vector is displayed at the true velocity vector position if that position is more than 2° from the caged position.

            referenced to the caged position. The ghost velocity vector flashes when limited. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, the flight path/pitch ladder is referenced to the waterline symbol when the velocity vector is caged.<br>Sustained climbs and descents can result in uncued vertical velocity placement errors and subsequent HUD velocity placement errors. Error magnitudes increase at slower airspeeds and lower altitudes. Errors of up to 3° have been observed in the landing configuration. Three minutes of level flight may be required to allow the INS to correct the vertical velocity function.<br>. 11. Flight path/pitch ladder. The vertical flight path angle of the aircraft is indicated by the positionof the velocity vector on the flight path/pitch ladder. The horizon and flight path/pitch angle lines represent the horizon and each 5° of angle between plus and minus 90°. Positive pitch lines are solid and are above the horizon line. Negative pitch lines are dashed and are below the horizon line. The outer segments of the lines point toward the horizon. Each line is numbered and the numbers rotate with the lines so that inverted flight can easily be determined. To aid in determining flight path angle when it is changing rapidly, the pitch lines are angled toward the horizon at an angle half that of the flight path angle. For example, the 50° pitch line is angled 25° toward the horizon. In level flight, the pitch lines are not angled. The zenith is indicated by a circle and the nadir is indicated by a circle with an X in it. Aircraft pitch angle can be determined by comparing the tops of the altitude and airspeed boxes (which represent the aircraft waterline) with the pitch ladder when the wings are level. However, since the flight path/pitch ladder normally rotates about the velocity vector, determination of pitch angle may be difficult at high roll angles.<br>. 12. Vertical velocity readout. This value is displayed above the altitude box and indicates verticalvelocity in feet per minute. This is only displayed in the NAV master mode. Descent is indicated with a minus sign.<br>. 13. HUD landing symbology. When any two landing gear are down, the Mach number, g, and peakg are deleted and, an AOA bracket, extended horizon bar, and waterline symbol appear. The center of the AOA bracket represents the optimum approach AOA. The bracket moves lower with respect to the velocity vector as AOA increases and moves higher as AOA decreases.<br>. 14. Waypoint/OAP, mark point, TACAN, or target data. Waypoint/OAP and mark data consists ofrange (horizontal), the steer to point identifier (W, O, or M), and number, located on the lower right corner of the HUD. TACAN data consists of slant range and a morse code identifier located on the lower right corner of the HUD. When a steer to point is designated, range remains displayed and the steer-to point identifier changes to TGT.<br>. 15. Coupled steering symbology. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, while coupled steering is engagedCPL SEQ#, CPL WYPT, CPL TCN, CPL BNK or CPL ASL appear on the right side of the HUD display above the navigation data.<br>. 16. ILS symbology. When ILS steering is selected, an azimuth deviation bar (localizer) and elevationdeviation bar (glideslope) appear on the HUD.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-103.<br><br>

            . 2.13.4.8.12 HUD Symbology Degrades. The avionics suite has built-in redundancy with two.<br><br>mission computers for data management and two DDI for symbol generation. Likewise, if the attitude select switch is in the AUTO or INS position, back-up data sources are automatically selected to provide HUD symbology when specific failures are detected. Refer to figure 2-27, for the HUD displays discussed below.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.13 INS Failure/HUD Symbology Degrades. When a failure occurs in the INS expect HUD.<br><br>bank angle, velocity vector, pitch ladder, and heading indications to be impacted. With GPS or EGI installed, the mission computer utilizes GPS information for the velocity vector. If INS attitude is valid but INS velocities are not valid, the mission computer automatically uses the INS attitude and GPS velocities to position a non-flashing velocity vector. With a degradation of the ADC, calibrated airspeed, barometric altitude, indicated Mach number, and vertical velocity indications may be impacted.<br>When the ASN-130 system reverts to the attitude heading reference system (AHRS) mode, the velocity vector flashes slowly indicating that the INS is still providing valid attitude information, but the ADC is now the data source for the velocity vector. An AHRS reversion can be the result of an INS BIT failure, or invalid INS velocity information. It is important to understand that AHRS is not an independent back-up platform, but actually a degraded INS system. In the AHRS mode, a very slight degrade in HUD attitude and velocity accuracy can be expected, warranting regular crosschecks of the standby instrumentation. A reversion to AHRS is accompanied by the master caution light, tone, and POS/ADC caution, provided that the INS has been selected on the HSI display as the position-keeping source.<br>When the INS experiences a total shutdown (dump) with the attitude select switch in AUTO or INS, or if the attitude switch is deliberately placed in standby, a stationary waterline symbol replaces the velocity vector indicating that the standby attitude reference indicator is now providing attitude data.<br>This failure is normally accompanied by the master caution light, tone, and INS ATT caution.

There is no significant degradation to flying qualities, departure resistance or roll performance with these failure indications.<br>If power to the HUD is lost, either due to a fault or by placing the HUD symbology brightness control knob to OFF, the attitude selector switch becomes inoperative. If an insidious INS failure is followed by a HUD failure, the only accurate source of attitude information available is the standby attitude reference indicator. The electronic attitude display indicator can be selected as an alternative display on the DDI. The STBY option available on the EADI operates independent of the attitude selector switch and allows selection of the standby attitude reference indicator as the source for display attitude information.<br>Due to the tendency of the standby attitude reference indicator to precess, it is suggested that flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) using the ARI as a primary attitude reference be minimized. A partial IFA is always recommended whenever possible to recover the INS attitude platform.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.14 ADC Failure/HUD Symbology Degrades. An ADC failure results in loss of associated.<br><br>data from the HUD display as shown in figure 2-27. An ADC failure also inhibits operation of cruise flight Automatic Throttle Control and disables the altitude signal used for IFF altitude reporting. An ADC failure may affect cabin air flow, cabin air temperature, and vent suit temperature.<br>Normal accurate air data and magnetic heading inputs that are supplied by the ADC to the mission computers are lost. However, flight aids reversion mechanization provides information to the pilot from the next best available source (figure 2-39).

            As the ADC degrades, loss of some or all of the following data from the HUD may occur:<br>. 1. Calibrated airspeed or barometric altitude. The loss of calibrated airspeed and/or barometricaltitude data results in activation of the landing gear handle warning light and tone. First reference the applicable standby airspeed or altitude indicator, then silence the tone.<br>. 2. Angle of Attack. Loss of AOA requires no action on the part of the pilot, as the FCC automaticallyprovides data for the HUD display. In fact, there is no indication provided to the pilot when this failure occurs.<br>. 3. Vertical velocity indicator. Upon loss of the vertical velocity indication, first check that theaircraft is in the NAV master mode and reference the standby vertical velocity indicator.<br>. 4. Mach number. Upon loss of the Mach number indication, reference the standby airspeedindicator.<br>The ADC can produce erroneous signals without cautions or advisories if the pitot or AOA probes receive damage. ADC inputs to the MC are used by the INS to help smooth or dampen pitch ladder and velocity vector position. A complete ADC failure does not immediately affect the pitch ladder/velocity vector, but these displays will eventually degrade. If subtle damage to the AOA probe is suspected, the pilot should make a crosscheck of airspeed with a wingman if possible. The standby airspeed indicator receives signals from the left pitot static probe, so it is accurate if only the right probe is damaged. AOA checks with a wingman should be made in landing configuration if a jammed AOA probe is suspected.<br>Crosschecking with flaps AUTO may give a satisfactory crosscheck, but the probe may be bent in such a way that AOA anomalies are accentuated on landing configuration. Landing with automatic throttle control (ATC) may be affected. If damage is suspected, ATC during landing is not recommended.<br>With the exception of a single AOA probe jammed on takeoff (see paragraph 15.32) if an AOA probe becomes jammed (does not move), the ADC and FCCs continue to receive valid signals until the pilot executes a maneuver that causes the reading between the AOA probes to differ more than 15°. The pilot receives a master caution and FCS caution. HUD displayed airspeed may be inaccurate without pilot error indications if a pitot tube is damaged. Be alert for unannunciated pitot tube or AOA probe damage after bird strikes, icing conditions, or IFR basket impact during air refueling.<br>With MC OFP 13C AND UP. Displays of the L and R AOA probe values, and the INS AOA (center) value, were added to the FCS status page. With MC OFP 13C and 15C, these AOA values are only displayed when the ADC declares the AOA valid (<15.5°). With MC OFP 17C and 19C, the L and R AOA values continue to be displayed even when the ADC declares the AOA invalid, but the values are lined out. The center AOA value is driven by the INS and is always displayed, regardless of AOA validity.<br>When the ADC declares AOA valid, the L and R AOA values can be boxed and selected, in the event one AOA is damaged. The center (INS) AOA value allows the pilot to compare against L and R AOA values to determine which is the good AOA probe. GAIN ORIDE must be selected to enable selection of a single probe to drive the HUD E-bracket. Even with one AOA probe selected, AOA indexer and approach lights are still driven by the average value to both probes and will be inaccurate. For carrier landings, advise the LSO that the external approach light indications are inaccurate.<br>If the ADC declares AOA invalid, the HUD E-bracket and AOA numeric displays disappear, and the indexer and external approach lights are inoperable.<br><br>. 2.13.4.8.15 HUD Advisory Data Symbology.

It includes fuel transfer controls and gaging capabilities, incorporates ground support equipment fuel transfer and gaging fault isolation functions, and provides interface for multiple sensors and controls. It provides analog to digital conversion of aircraft parameters. In addition, BIT fail indications are stored in the SDC to be displayed by the maintenance status panel (MSP) for readout by maintenance personnel after the flight, or on the integrated fuel/engine indicator (IFEI) for readout during the flight.<br>The fuel format is available on any DDI by selection of the FUEL push button from the menu format, and the RESET SDC option is available from the fuel format. RESET SDC is used to reset the SDC by momentarily removing power to the SDC. When the push button is first pressed, the RESET portion of the button legend is boxed. The box is removed when the SDC reestablishes AVMUX communication or 15 seconds after the push button was pressed. The RESET SDC legend is removed from the fuel format if the CSC is not communicating on the AVMUX.<br>In aircraft equipped with GPS, it is important to manually load Zulu time as this aids in satellite acquisition. If local time is desired, it should be set after takeoff. The aircraft signal data computer is used to initialize GPS. At GPS power up, the SDC time and date are automatically sent to the GPS to aid it in the acquisition of satellites. Once the satellites are acquired for the first time, the GPS obtains a good satellite time. This time is then backloaded to the SDC, synchronizing the SDC with precise GPS time.

Ground-based stations that process data for TAMMAC include the Tactical Automated Mission Planning System (TAMPS) and the Automated Maintenance Environment (AME). Theater data is installed on the maploading card using TAMPS.<br>The AMU is a functional replacement for the existing DSS, more commonly referred to as the Memory Unit (MU). The AMU contains two PC card receptacles, one for maintenance (ground support) operations and one for mission (pilot) operations. This unique configuration allows mainte- nance and mission data to be separated both pre- and post-flight which reduces logistics coordination and facilitates operational readiness. Three types of PC cards are used in the TAMMAC subsystem operation: 1) Mission Card, 2) Maintenance Card, and 3) Map Loading Card.<br><br>. 2.13.10.1 TAMMAC Status Monitoring. TAMMAC status monitoring functions are based on the.<br><br>existing MU and DVMS status monitoring functionality. Some of the existing cautions, advisories, BIT mechanizations, and MSP codes that satisfied the requirements for the MU and DVMS were not changed. However, additional status monitoring functionality was added to accommodate changes to the MC/AMU/DMC interfaces including, but not limited to, the PC cards and the High Speed <br>Interface Bus (HSIB).<br><br>All existing display references to the MU and DMC are unchanged.

The extinguisher bottle is in the aft fuselage between the engines. The bottle contains a nontoxic gaseous agent which provides a one-shot extinguishing capability. Direct current electrical power (essential 24/28 volt dc and engine start 24/28 volt dc buses) is required to operate the system.<br>The systems operate on battery power with the battery switch in either ON or ORIDE. The systems provide engine/AMAD and APU fire warning, emergency shutdown and selective fire extinguishing.<br><br>. 2.14.1 Fire Warning/Extinguisher Lights/Voice Alert. The three fire warning/extinguisher lights.<br><br>are pushbutton switch indicators which come on when a fire condition exists. Two of the fire warning/extinguisher lights are labeled FIRE, one is mounted on the top left corner and the other on the top right corner of the instrument panel. The two FIRE warning/extinguisher lights are guarded.<br>The left FIRE light indicates a fire condition in the left engine bay. The right FIRE light indicates a fire condition in the right engine bay. The APU FIRE light is positioned inboard of the right FIRE light. It indicates a fire condition in the auxiliary power unit bay. A voice alert warning is activated anytime a fire warning light comes on. If the left FIRE light comes on, the ENGINE FIRE LEFT voice alert is activated. If the right FIRE light comes on the ENGINE FIRE RIGHT voice alert is activated.<br>If the APU FIRE light comes on, the APU FIRE voice alert is activated.

            engine fire warning/extinguisher light shuts off fuel to the engine at the feed tank. With READY on, pressing the fire extinguisher pushbutton discharges the fire extinguisher bottle and turns on the DISCH light. There is no indication of actual discharge of the fire extinguisher bottle.<br><br>. 2.14.3 APU Fire Extinguishing System. The APU fire extinguishing system can be either manually.<br><br>or automatically actuated. To manually actuate the system, the fire extinguisher bottle is first armed and the APU shutdown by pressing the APU FIRE warning/extinguisher light. When pressed, the APU FIRE light stays in and a barber pole indication appears alongside the light. The extinguisher bottle is then discharged into the APU bay by pressing the FIRE EXTGH pushbutton with the READY light on. Discharge of the bottle is delayed 10 seconds after the light is pressed, allowing the APU time to spool-down before the extinguishing agent is introduced. If on the ground, the APU fire extinguishing system is actuated automatically. The result is the same as with manual actuation, with the APU shutting down immediately after a fire is detected and the fire extinguisher discharging into the APU bay 10 seconds later. The automatic system is prevented from operating during flight by the action of a WOW relay.<br><br>. 2.14.4 Engine/AMAD Fire Extinguishing System. Actuation of the engine/AMAD fire extinguish-.<br><br>ing system can only be performed manually. The system is armed by lifting the guard and pressing the affected FIRE warning/extinguisher light. This also shuts off fuel to the engine at the engine feed shutoff valves and closes the crossfeed valve. When pressed, the FIRE light stays in and a barber pole indication appears in the switch guard. The extinguisher bottle is discharged into the affected engine bay by pressing the FIRE EXTGH pushbutton with the READY light on. If more than one FIRE light is pushed, extinguishing agent is distributed to selected bays, but concentration is insufficient to extinguish fire.<br>The probability of extinguishing a fire and preventing relights is greatly increased by immediately discharging the extinguisher.<br><br>. 2.14.5 Fire and Bleed Air Test Switch. Each of the three warning/extinguisher lights contains four.<br><br>individual light bulbs which are simultaneously tested by actuation of the lights test switch on the interior lights panel. Operation of the lights test switch tests only the light bulbs in the warning/ extinguisher lights and requires ac electrical power on the aircraft. The fire/bleed air leakage detection sensors and associated circuits are tested by the fire and bleed air test switch. Operation of the fire and bleed air test switch requires power on the essential 24/28 volt dc bus. The fire and bleed air switch is on the fire test panel on the left console. When actuated to TEST A or TEST B, the fire warning, bleed air leak detection and voice alert warning circuitry for the designated loop is tested. If a malfunction exists in a fire detection loop associated with the APU FIRE warning/extinguisher light, none of the four individual bulbs in the indicator come on. If a malfunction exists in a fire detection loop associated with either FIRE warning/extinguisher light, only the individual bulb (or bulbs) associated with the malfunctioning sensor do not come on. Care must be taken to detect bulbs that are not on in the FIRE warning/extinguisher during the loop test. Switch actuation also turns on the L BLEED and R BLEED warning lights and the L BLD OFF and R BLD OFF caution displays while the switch is activated and closes the left and right bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valves indicating the designated loop bleed air detection sensors and circuitry are operational. The L(R) BLEED warning lights go out after the switch is released to NORM. The L(R) BLD OFF caution displays remain on until the valves are reopened. To open the valves after test, there must be ac power on the aircraft and the bleed air knob must be rotated through OFF to NORM.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-121.<br><br>

Latching provisions consist of three latch hooks on the bottom of each side of the canopy frame and two forward indexer pins on the lower leading edge of the canopy frame. When the canopy is closed, the latch hooks and indexer pins engage fittings along the canopy sill and the canopy actuator rotates the canopy actuation link over-center, locking the canopy. A mechanical brake in the canopy actuator motor provides a redundant lock. An inflatable seal, installed around the edge of the canopy frame, retains cockpit pressure when the canopy is locked. A rain seal is installed outboard of the pressure seal to divert rain water away from the cockpit. The F/A-18A/B and F/A-18C/D windscreens have been tested to determine their bird strike resistance. See figure 2-31 for test results.<br><br>. 2.15.1.1 Normal Canopy Operation. Normal canopy operation is provided by the internal canopy.<br><br>control switch (figure 2-32) on the right side of the cockpit under the canopy sill. An external canopy control switch provides powered operation of the canopy from outside the aircraft. With no generator or external electrical power on the aircraft, battery power is available for at least five open/close cycles of the canopy. If no electrical power is available for canopy operation, a back-up crank system is provided to manually power the canopy actuator. Internally, the manual crank is under the left canopy sill. Externally, manual handcrank provisions are provided by a drive socket located flush on the mold line, outside of the internal handcrank. Internally, 70 counterclockwise crank turns are required to fully open the canopy; externally, 35 counterclockwise crank turns are required.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-122.<br><br>

See Ejection Seat, Foldout section, for ejection seat illustrations. The seat system includes an initiation system which, after jettisoning the canopy and positioning the occupant for ejection, fires the telescopic seat catapult.<br>In the event of a canopy jettison failure during ejection, canopy breakers on the top of the seat give the capability for ejection through the canopy. As the seat departs the aircraft and the catapult reaches the end of its stroke a rocket motor on the bottom of the seat is fired. The thrust of the rocket motor sustains the thrust of the catapult to eject the seat to a height sufficient for parachute deployment even if ejection is initiated at zero speed, zero altitude in a substantially level attitude.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Safe escape is provided for most combinations of aircraft altitude, speed, attitude, and flight path within the envelope of 0 to 600 KIAS airspeed and 0 to 50,000 ft. altitude.<br><br>. 2.15.3.1 SJU-5/A and 6/A Seat. Shortly after departing the aircraft a drogue gun is fired to deploy.<br><br>the drogue chute. The drogue chute either remains attached to the top of the seat or is released to deploy the main parachute, depending on altitude and the number of g’s applied on the seat. After a delay of 1.50 seconds, an automatic time release mechanism opens the main parachute container and releases the drogue chute to deploy the main parachute when conditions of altitude and g forces are met. The seat operates in three modes. At high altitude, the seat is allowed to freefall to below 14,500 feet MSL before the time release mechanism activates. At medium altitude, the time release mechanism actuates when the seat is below 13,000 and above 7,500 feet MSL and acceleration forces are below 3 g’s. At low altitude, below 7,500 feet, g forces are not used as a condition for deploying the main parachute. The time release mechanism also releases the lap belts, inertia reel restraint straps, and leg restraint lines. Both the drogue gun and time release mechanism are actuated on ejection by trip rods attached to the aircraft structure.<br>The main parachute is a 17-foot aeroconical canopy type, stored along with the drogue chute(s) in a headbox container on top of the ejection seat.

            MSL if the ejection occurred in or above this altitude range. The emergency barostatic unit operates immediately after a 4-second delay if the ejection occurred below 14,000 feet MSL. An emergency restraint release (manual override) system provides an additional back-up in the event of failure of the barostatic release unit. The seat is stabilized and the forward speed retarded by a drogue chute that is attached to the top and bottom of the seat. The parachute deployment rocket is automatically fired to withdraw the parachute from its deployment bag. Full canopy inflation is inhibited until the g forces are sufficiently reduced to minimize opening shock. There are five modes of operation. See figure 2-34 for parameters that determine the mode of operation and the corresponding parachute deployment and drogue chute release times. At high altitude the drogue chute deploys to decelerate and stabilize the seat. The seat falls drogue retarded to 18,000 feet MSL where the drogue is released, the main parachute is deployed, and seat/man separation occurs. At medium altitude, between 18,000 and 8,000 feet MSL, and at low altitude below 8,000 feet MSL parachute deployment is automatically delayed from 0.45 to 2.90 seconds (depending upon airspeed and altitude after seat first motion) to allow the drogue chute to decelerate and stabilize the seat depending upon airspeed and altitude.<br>The main parachute is a 21-foot aeroconical canopy type, stored in a headbox container on top of the ejection seat. The parachute is steerable, and contains water deflation pockets which aid in dumping air from the canopy after landing in water. The seat drogue chute is stored in a separate container on top of the drogue deployment catapult. The seat contains controls for adjusting seat height, and for locking and unlocking the inertia reel shoulder restraint straps. A survival kit is installed in the seat pan.<br><br>. 2.15.3.3 SEAWATER Activated Release System (SEAWARS). This is a seawater activated system.<br><br>that automatically releases the parachute from the crewmember. When the sensing-release units are immersed in seawater, cartridges are fired which allow the crewmember to separate from the parachute.<br>. 2.15.3.4 Ejection Control Handle. The ejection control handle, between the pilot’s legs on the frontof the seat pan, is the only means by which ejection is initiated. The handle, molded in the shape of a loop, can be grasped by one or two hands. To initiate ejection, a 20 to 40 pound pull removes the handle from its housing, and a continued pull of 30 to 60 pounds is required to pull both sears from the dual initiators. Either of the initiators can fire the seat. After ejection, the handle remains attached to the seat. The ejection control handle can be safed by the ejection seat safe/armed handle.<br><br>. 2.15.3.5 Ejection Seat SAFE/ARMED Handle. To prevent seat ejection, an ejection seat safe/armed.<br><br>handle is provided. The handle, forward on the right seat armrest, safeties the seat when rotated up and forward, and arms the seat when it is rotated aft and down. The safe/armed handle is locked when placed to either of these two positions and the handle must be unlocked before changing positions by squeezing a locking lever within the handle cutout. When in the armed position the visible portion of the handle (from the occupant’s vantage point) is colored yellow and black with the word ARMED showing. In the safe position, the visible portion is colored white with the word SAFE showing. The seat is safed only when the word SAFE is entirely visible on the inboard side of the SAFE/ARM handle and the handle is locked in the detent. Placing the handle to the SAFE position causes a pin to be inserted into the ejection firing mechanism to prevent withdrawal of the sears from the dual seat initiators.<br><br>. 2.15.3.5.1 CK SEAT Caution (F/A-18C/D). The CK SEAT caution light is located on the caution.<br><br>light panel and repeats the DDI CHECK SEAT caution display. The caution comes on when the right throttle is at MIL or above, weight is on wheels, and the ejection seat is not armed.<br>. 2.15.3.6 Shoulder Harness Inertia Reel.

Once locked, the pilot can normally lean forward again after a slight release in pressure on the reel straps.<br>. 2.15.3.8 Leg Restraint System. A leg restraint system is located on the front of the ejection seat. Thefunction of the system is to secure the occupant’s legs to the seat during ejection. The system consists of two adjustable leg garters, a restraint line and a snubber box for each leg. One garter is worn on the thigh approximately 3 inches above the knee and one garter is worn on the lower leg in-line with the snubber as illustrated in figure 2-35. The restraint lines are routed through the garter rings and the snubber box. One end of each restraint line is secured to the cockpit floor and the other, after being routed through the snubber box and both garter rings, is secured to the seat just outboard of the snubber box by a releaseable pin. During ejection, inertia draws the legs in against the front of the seat bucket and the legs are retained in this position by the leg restraint line. The restraint line is snubbed and separates at the tension ring on each leg line. At man-seat separation, the pins on the other end of the lines are released by the time release mechanism. The pins are also released when the manual override handle is pulled. Both the lower garter and thigh garter contain a quick release buckle which disconnects the ring through which the leg restraint line runs, permitting the pilot to egress from the aircraft wearing both upper and lower garters. In addition, toe clips are installed on the tops of the rudder pedals to prevent contact between the toes and the instrument panel during ejection.<br>. 2.15.3.8.1 Leg Restraint Snubber Release Tabs. The leg restraint lines are adjusted to give the pilotmore leg movement by pulling inboard the leg restraint snubber release tabs (figure 2-35) and simultaneously pulling the leg restraint lines forward through the snubber box.<br><br>. 2.15.3.9 Survival Kit (SKU-3/A). The SKU-3/A survival kit is used with the SJU-5/6 ejection seat.<br><br>and contains provisions for survival after ejection or ditching (figure 2-34, sheet 1). The kit is composed of a two-piece fiberglass container. The lower portion of the kit contains emergency provisions and an inflatable raft. The upper portion of the kit, containing a 50 cubic inch emergency oxygen supply, serves as the kit cover and has a seat cushion attached to the top. During ejection the emergency oxygen is tripped by an automatic oxygen operating cable lanyard attached to the cockpit floor. The kit contains an emergency oxygen green ring on the left forward part of the upper kit. A flexible oxygen and communications hose is installed in the left aft side of the upper kit to provide a connection to the pilot for oxygen and communications. After ejection or after the emergency oxygen green ring is pulled, emergency oxygen is supplied to the pilot through the hose until the emergency oxygen is exhausted.<br>The survival kit is secured to the seat by two lugs installed on the aft upper corners of the kit, and a lug installed through a bracket on the front of the kit.

            the sides of the kit. These straps connect to fittings on the pilot’s lower torso harness to secure the pilot to the kit, and thus to the seat. The restraint provided by the three lugs is released by the action of the time release mechanism at seat-man separation after ejection, or by the action resulting from pulling the manual override handle. Additional restraint is provided by straps which connect the survival kit to sticker clips in the seat. The straps require a force of between 40 to 55 pounds to separate from the sticker clips at man-seat separation after ejection or during ground egress. The kit is equipped with an AN/URT-33A radio beacon locator which actuates during ejection at man-seat separation. The kit can be deployed after ejection during parachute descent by pulling the survival kit release handle on the right side of the kit. This unlocks the kit causing the lower half to fall away while remaining attached to the upper half by a dropline. The liferaft, also attached to the dropline, falls away by gravity and inflates. An equipment bag containing the other survival aids falls away but remains attached to the upper kit lid by a lanyard. If the pilot lands in water before deploying the survival kit, the liferaft can be inflated by pulling the survival kit release handle and then reaching into the kit and pulling the actuating cable on the liferaft CO2 bottle.<br><br>. 2.15.3.10 Seat Survival Kit (SKU-10/A). The SKU-10/A survival kit is used with the SJU-17.<br><br>ejection seats. This survival kit, which fits into the seat bucket, is a contoured rigid platform which contains an emergency oxygen system and a fabric survival rucksack (figure 2-36, sheet 2). A cushion on top of the platform provides a seat for the aircrew.<br>The rigid platform forms a hard protective cover to the survival package and oxygen system and is retained in position in the seat bucket by brackets at the front and lugs secured in the lower harness locks at the rear.

            A flexible oxygen and communication hose is installed in the left aft side of the upper kit to provide a connection to the aircrew for aircraft oxygen and communication. An emergency oxygen cylinder, pressure reducer and associated pipework are mounted on the underside of the platform. A green manual emergency oxygen operating handle is mounted on the left side of the platform and a pressure gage is on the inside face of the left leg support. The emergency oxygen can be activated manually by pulling the green emergency oxygen handle upwards. The green emergency oxygen handle can be reset, thus shutting off the flow of emergency oxygen, by pushing downward on the button on the front end of the emergency oxygen handle assembly. The emergency oxygen is automatically activated during ejection by a lanyard connected between the floor and the survival kit. An AN/URT-33A locator beacon is located in a cutout in the left leg support. The beacon is actuated during ejection by a lanyard connected to the emergency oxygen lanyard.<br>The survival rucksack is retained to the underside of the rigid platform by five fabric straps and a double cone and pin release system. The package accommodates a liferaft and survival aids. Two yellow manual deployment handles are mounted on the aft surface of the kit and pulling either handle enables the aircrew to deploy the raft and survival package after man/seat separation. The liferaft inflates automatically on survival package deployment and is attached to the survival package with a line. If the survival kit must be deployed after water entry, a snatch pull on the red manual activation handle, near the CO2 bottle, is required to inflate the liferaft.<br><br>. 2.15.3.11 Manual Override Handle. A manual override handle permits releasing the pilot’s lower.<br><br>harness restraints and the leg restraint lines for emergency egress, and permits resuming part of the ejection sequence (man-seat separation and main parachute deployment) in the event of sequencing failure during ejection. The manual override handle, on the right side of seat bucket and just aft of the ejection seat safe/arm handle, is actuated by first pressing a thumb button on the forward part of the handle and then rotating the handle up and aft. If the handle is actuated on the ground or in the air before ejection, the following restraints are released: survival kit attachment lugs, inertia reel straps, and the leg restraint lines. During ground emergency egress, after the manual override handle is pulled and the parachute riser fittings are released, the pilot is free to evacuate the aircraft with the survival kit still attached. On the SJU-5/6 seat, if the manual override handle is actuated after ejection before man-seat separation occurs, the following events take place: release of same restraints as described in the emergency ground egress, firing of the manual override initiator cartridge which fires both the time release mechanism and drogue gun secondary cartridge (if they haven’t been fired), flaps of main parachute pack are unlocked, and the scissor shackle on the top of the seat is released to allow the drogue chute to deploy the main parachute. On the SJU-17 seats, if the manual override handle is actuated after ejection before man-seat separation occurs, the following events take place: release of survival kit attachment lugs, negative-g strap, leg restraint lines, inertia reel straps; firing of the manual override initiator cartridge; firing of the barostatic release unit; and firing of the parachute deployment rocket which deploys the parachute. The ejection seat safe/armed handle automatically rotates to the SAFE position whenever the manual override handle is actuated.<br>Do not pull the manual override handle in flight. Pulling the handle disconnects the survival kit attachment lugs and leg restraint lines, inertia reel straps, and safeties the seat.<br>. 2.15.3.12 Seat Bucket Position Switch.

            . 2.16 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM.<br><br>The environmental control system (ECS) provides conditioned air to the cockpit and avionics. The ECS also provides cockpit pressurization, OBOGS source air, anti-g suit pressure, fuel tank pressur- ization, throttle boost, windshield anti-ice and rain removal, windshield defog, canopy seal, and waveguide pressurization. The ECS uses bleed air from the engines for operation. See Environmental Control System, Foldout section, for environmental control system illustration.<br><br>. 2.16.1 Bleed Air System. Bleed air comes from the compressor section of each engine. A primary.<br><br>bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valve is mounted on each engine and controls the flow of bleed air into the engine bay bleed air ducts. This valve can be manually commanded closed by the BLEED AIR knob, or is automatically commanded closed by the bleed air leak detection system, system overpressure sensor, or total loss of ac power. When the valve is commanded closed, the associated L or R BLD OFF caution is displayed.<br>The engine bay bleed air ducts are routed into the keel and are tied together. This common bleed air duct is routed through the secondary pressure regulator and shutoff valve which controls the flow of bleed air into the rest of the ECS. This valve can be manually commanded closed by the OFF position of the BLEED AIR knob, or is automatically commanded closed by the bleed air leak detection system or system overpressure sensor. The common bleed air duct is then routed from the keel across the top of the fuselage fuel tanks to the primary heat exchanger. For crossbleed engine starts, bleed air is routed to the air turbine starters through the isolation valve. A bleed air leak detection system which utilizes temperature-sensing elements is installed. Elements are routed on each engine bay bleed air duct. If a leak is detected in an engine bay bleed air duct, a single L or R BLEED warning light is illuminated, the associated ‘‘Bleed Air Left/Right’’ voice alert is annunciated, and the associated primary bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valve is commanded closed resulting in a single L or R BLD OFF caution. An engine bay fire or missing engine borescope plug can also result in single bleed air leak indications. Bleed air leak detection elements are also routed along the common bleed air ducts. If a leak is detected in these common bleed air ducts, both L and R BLEED warning lights are illuminated, both ‘‘Bleed Air Left and Right’’ voice alerts are annunciated, both primary bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valves are commanded closed resulting in both L and R BLD OFF cautions, and the secondary pressure regulator and shutoff valve is commanded closed.<br>. • BLD OFF cautions are based on command signals to the valves and arenot an indication of actual valve position. A valve could still be open allowing bleed air to leak. The BLEED AIR knob should be turned to the appropriate OFF position to backup the automatic shutoff func- tion.<br>. • If a single BLEED warning light does not extinguish after theassociated BLD OFF caution is displayed, a borescope plug may be leaking or the associated shutoff valve may still be open. Shutting down the associated engine will eliminate the leak. If both BLEED warning lights do not extinguish after both BLD OFF cautions are displayed, a shutoff valve may still be open. Reducing power on both engines will reduce the temperature and flow of the leak minimizing aircraft damage.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-137.<br><br>

The jettison systems consist of the emergency jettison system and the.<br><br>selective jettison system.<br><br>. 2.17.1.1 Emergency Jettison Button. The emergency jettison system utilizes the emergency jettison.<br><br>button to jettison all stores/launchers/racks from the BRU-32A racks on the five pylon weapon stations (2, 3, 5, 7, and 8). The landing gear handle must be up or weight off wheels to enable the emergency jettison button. The emergency jettison button, labeled EMERG JETT, is a momentary pushbutton on the left edge of the instrument panel and is painted with alternating black and yellow stripes. The button must be held pressed during the entire jettison sequence. Jettison is sequential by station pairs starting with stations 2 and 8, then stations 3 and 7, and finally, station 5. The BIT advisory and an SMS BIT status of DGD is the only enunciated indication of a stuck emergency jettison button.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Hold EMERG JETT pressed for at least 375 msec to ensure all stores are jettisoned.<br>If the EMERG JETT button is stuck, emergency jettison is activated as soon as the aircraft goes W off W.<br><br>. 2.17.1.2 Selective Jettison.

Initiate jettison by selecting RACK/LCHR or STORES on the selective jettison knob, select the hung store station by pressing the appropriate station jettison select button, and then press the JETT center pushbutton of the selective jettison knob. The SMS provides a jettison signal to fire the auxiliary cartridge in the BRU-32/A rack on which the hung store or store and rack/launcher combination is loaded. After the cartridge is fired, the store or rack/launcher is gravity dropped with the store in a safe condition. This switch is also used with some weapons for a second normal release attempt after these weapons have been hung during a first normal release attempt. Refer to NTRP 3-22.4-FA18A-D and NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP for these weapons and procedures.<br><br>. 2.17.2 Warning/Caution/Advisory Lights and Displays. The warning/caution/advisory lights and.<br><br>displays system provides visual indications of normal aircraft operation and system malfunctions affecting safe operation of the aircraft. The lights are on various system instruments and control panels in the cockpit. The red warning lights normally indicate a systems malfunction that could be a severe hazard to further flight, and may require immediate action. Caution lights and displays normally, but not always, indicate malfunctions that require attention but not immediate action. After the malfunction has been corrected, warning and caution lights and caution displays go out. Advisory lights and displays indicate safe or normal conditions and supply information for routine purposes. On aircraft 163985 AND UP, warning, caution and advisory displays are NVG compatible. Caution and advisory displays appear on the left, right or center DDIs, depending on the number of DDIs in operation. The advisory displays start at the bottom of the DDI display and are preceded by ADV. The caution displays, in larger characters than the advisory displays, appear immediately above the advisory displays. The caution lights, located on the caution lights panel and the instrument panel, are yellow lights. The advisory lights, scattered throughout the cockpit, are white or green. Turned on lights on the caution lights panel flash when overheated to prevent light damage.<br><br>. 2.17.2.1 Master Caution. A yellow MASTER CAUTION light, on the upper left part of the.<br><br>instrument panel, comes on when any of the caution lights or caution displays come on. The MASTER CAUTION light goes out when it is pressed (reset). An audio tone is initiated whenever the MASTER CAUTION light comes on. The tone is of 0.8 second duration. The tone consists of a 0.25-second sound followed by a 0.15-second sound of higher pitch, followed by one repetition of these sounds. Once sounded, the tone does not repeat unless the original condition causing the tone clears and recurs 5 seconds after the first tone, regardless of whether or not the MASTER CAUTION is reset. Additional cautions sound the tone, regardless of whether or not the MASTER CAUTION is reset, providing about 5 seconds have elapsed since the previous caution. Pressing the MASTER CAUTION when it is not illuminated causes the uncorrected caution and advisory displays on the DDIs to reposition to the left and to a lower level, provided there is available space vacated by corrected caution and advisory displays. To restack the cautions and advisories when the MASTER CAUTION is lighted, the MASTER CAUTION must be pressed twice: first, to turn off the MASTER CAUTION light and second, to reposition the caution and advisory displays. A reset MASTER CAUTION light (and tone) comes on providing there is at least one uncorrected caution present when weight is on the wheels and both throttles are moved beyond approximately 80% rpm or, providing both throttles were below 80% for at least 60 seconds.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-143.<br><br>

The warning/caution/ advisory lights are dimmed by the warning/caution lights knob, and they are tested by the lights test switch. See lighting equipment, this chapter, for operation of the warning/caution lights knob and the lights test switch. The following lights can be dimmed by the warning/caution lights knob, but once in the dimmed lighting range cannot be varied in intensity: MASTER CAUTION light, landing gear handle warning, L BAR warning, HOOK warning, L BLEED warning, R BLEED warning, APU FIRE warning, left and right engine FIRE warning.<br>. 2.17.3 Voice Alert System. For certain critical warnings and cautions, voice alert transmissions aresent to the pilot’s headset. The message is repeated twice; for example, “APU FIRE, APU FIRE”. The voice alert requires no reset action on the pilot’s part and the alert is not repeated unless the original condition ceases for 5 seconds or more and then recurs. The ALTITUDE voice alert, when initiated by the primary radar low altitude warning, has a high priority for its first annunciation and is repeated continuously at the lowest priority until reset or disabled by the pilot. For cautions with voice alert, the voice alert replaces the master caution tone; however, the master caution tone backs up the voice alert system, and provides a tone if the voice alert system malfunctions. FIRE, APU FIRE, L BLEED, and R BLEED warnings are not backed up by the master caution tone. Voice alert is the only audio warning for these problems. With dual generator failure, the following voice alert warnings operate from battery power: APU FIRE, L(R) FIRE, and L(R) BLEED. The ALTITUDE voice alert warning, all voice alert cautions, and the master caution tone are inoperative on battery power during dual generator failure.<br>Once a voice alert has been activated, it cannot be interrupted by a higher priority voice alert.

The terrain awareness.<br><br>warning system alerts the aircrew of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) condition during all mission phases. The system operates any time that the navigation mission computer (MC1) and TAMMAC digital mapping set (DMS) are functional. TAWS functions as a safety backup system and not as a performance aid. TAWS has been designed to eliminate false warnings, minimize nuisance warnings, and generate consistent aircrew response in all aircraft master modes. Five possible voice warnings are provided to indicate the correct initial response to an impending CFIT condition, and a visual cue is provided to indicate the recovery direction of pull, or in some instances, to command an increase in turn rate. All TAWS warnings should be treated as though an imminent flight into terrain condition exists. Pilot response to a TAWS warning should be instinctive and immediate.<br>TAWS uses data from the following inputs: ADC, FCC, INS, RADALT, GPS, and digital terrain elevation data (DTED). DTED resides in the DMS as part of TAMMAC and is used to provide the forward-prediction capability that protects against flight into rising terrain. The TAWS option is reached, by pressing MENU-HSI-DATA-A/C as shown in figure 2-38. The TAWS option boxes automatically at start-up.<br>When a DMS is not installed in the aircraft or is not operational, protection from CFIT events is provided by the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). BIT may be initiated on the DMS by pressing the appropriate pushtile of the BIT display. The BIT can take up to 185 seconds to complete.<br>During the BIT, TAWS is not operational. Therefore, the GPWS algorithm is used to determine the presence of possible CFIT events. There is no capability for pilot selection of GPWS if DMS is operational. The GPWS algorithm runs continuously with outputs being overwritten if TAWS is operational. This prevents erroneous values during an unexpected transition from TAWS to GPWS.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-145.<br><br>

            . 2.17.4.1 TAWS Modes. TAWS has two operational modes: TAWS-with-DTED, and TAWS- without-.<br><br>DTED. These modes switch automatically depending upon the available sensor data and flight phase.<br>When the aircraft position (latitude and longitude) is accurately known and DTED for the local area has been loaded onto the DMS (during the theater load process), TAWS is in the TAWS-with-DTED mode and provides protection against varying terrain ahead of the aircraft. When the aircraft position is not accurately known, DTED for the local area is unavailable, or TAWS determines the aircraft is in a landing phase, TAWS transitions to the TAWS-without-DTED mode and provides protection against flight into level or descending terrain as GPWS does.<br>When operating over the ocean, DTED does not exist and TAWS will be in the TAWS-without- DTED mode. However, there is no degradation in protection because the ocean is relatively flat. As the aircraft approaches the coast or islands, DTED may be available (depending upon the theater load) and TAWS will automatically switch back to the TAWS-with-DTED mode.<br>Operation of TAWS in the TAWS-without-DTED mode is still an improvement over GPWS as TAWS incorporates a more robust performance model and additional input sensor redundancy.<br><br>. 2.17.4.2 TAWS Operation. TAWS incorporates signal processing that determines a best estimate of.<br><br>aircraft position and altitude (AGL and MSL). TAWS protection algorithm continuously computes two recovery trajectories: Vertical Recovery Trajectory (VRT) and Oblique Recovery Trajectory (ORT). VRT is the standard GPWS-like recovery: roll to wings-level, if needed, and pull to recover.<br>ORT assumes that you maintain the current bank angle and pull to recover (increase turn rate). Both <br>computed trajectories include the following assumptions:<br><br>Figure 2-38. TAWS ON/OFF Pushbutton <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-146.<br><br>

            a. Pilot Response Time is the time from issuance of a TAWS warning to the time that the pilot actually initiates recovery. Pilot Response Time is set at 1.3 seconds.<br>b. Roll Recovery Phase is the time necessary to roll the aircraft to near wings-level. This assumes at least ½ lateral stick will be used for bank angles less than 70° and at least ¾ lateral stick will be used for bank angles ≥ 70°.<br>. c. G-Onset Phase is the time required to pull to the target recovery g. The target recovery g is80% of the instantaneous g available, or 5g, whichever is less. The g-onset phase assumes that rapid aft stick motion will be used (full deflection within ¾ second). In addition, TAWS assumes that throttles will be moved to MAX if below corner speed and to IDLE if above corner speed.<br>. d. Dive Recovery Phase is the remainder of the trajectory until terrain clearance is achieved.TAWS assumes a terrain clearance of 50 ft.<br>When TAWS senses that the aircraft is in the landing configuration, the recovery assumptions must change since the desire is to land. TAWS defines the landing phase as below 500 ft AGL, less than 200 KCAS, landing gear down and locked, and more than one minute since a waveoff or takeoff. In the landing phase, TAWS protects against landings of greater than the structural limit of the landing gear (1584 fpm). To allow this, TAWS switches to TAWS-without-DTED and provides a warning when the landing is predicted to exceed the structural limit of the landing gear.<br>TAWS provides protection against gear-up landings. When the aircraft is below 200 KCAS, below 150 ft AGL, more than one minute since waveoff or takeoff, and the landing gear is not down and locked, a TAWS warning is provided.<br><br>. 2.17.4.3 TAWS Warnings. TAWS provides clear, unambiguous, and directive aural and visual cues.<br><br>to the aircrew. Aural warnings provide the aircrew with a wake-up call and correct initial response while visual warnings provide the aircrew with correct follow-on recovery information.<br><br>. 2.17.4.3.1 Voice Warnings. TAWS uses the ACI to provide aural cues to the aircrew. The aural cues.<br><br>are distinct from any other cues that the aircrew may receive. The TAWS voice alert warnings are:<br>″Roll−Left...Roll−Left″, ″Roll−Right.....Roll−Right″, ″Pull−Up...Pull−Up″, ″Power...Power″, and ″Check Gear″. Each of these warnings is issued at a level 3−6 dB above the present voice alerts. The TAWS voice warnings provide a wake−up call to the aircrew and indicate the most appropriate initial response for the given aircraft state, not necessarily the only required response. The aural cue repeats until the warning condition is cleared. TAWS aural warnings have priority over all current aural tones.<br>Note that TAWS requires a -1018 or greater ACI load (or MIDS equivalent) which is capable of generating the ″Roll Left/Right″ warnings. Earlier ACI loads were only capable of generating ″Roll Out″ warnings and are not desired for use with TAWS.<br>A ″Roll Right...Roll Right″ warning is issued when a roll to the right is the correct initial response.<br>A ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ warning is issued when a roll to the left is the correct initial response.<br>A ″Power...Power″ warning is issued when the roll requirement conditions have not been met and adding power is the correct initial response. This occurs when the aircraft is below 200 KCAS, the AOA is above 8.5° for flaps HALF or FULL (or 18° AOA for up and away configuration) and the throttle is not already at MAX. The correct response to this warning is to select MAX afterburner.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-147.<br><br>

            A ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ warning is issued when the above conditions have not been met and pulling up is the correct response or when the ORT is the recovery trajectory.<br>When a warning is given to protect against a gear-up landing, the following aural cues may be heard:<br>″Pull Up...Pull Up″ followed two seconds later by ″Check Gear″ when the gear handle is in the UP position and a gear-up landing condition has been assessed (repeated every 4 seconds).<br>″Check Gear″ repeated every 8 seconds when the gear handle is down and a gear up landing condition has been assessed.<br><br>. 2.17.4.3.2 Visual Warnings. A visual recovery arrow is provided in the center of the HUD and HUD.<br><br>format on the DDI. The recovery arrow indicates the direction of recovery. The visual warning is displayed when a CFIT condition is present and is removed when the CFIT condition is cleared.<br>TAWS visual recovery cues are designed to be used in conjunction with TAWS voice warnings.<br>There are several voice warning/visual recovery cue combinations. When the arrow points UP in the HUD (i.e., along the lift vector), a longitudinal pull is the correct response and an aural ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ is heard. This is a VRT recovery if the aircraft is close to wings level, or it is an ORT (increased turn rate) recovery if the aircraft is banked such that the TAWS algorithm assessed that an increased turn rate would provide the quickest recovery from an impending CFIT condition. Figures 2-39 and 2-40 depict these two situations. Both situations require a longitudinal pull as the correct response, however, the first case (VTR) depicts a dive recovery while the second case (ORT) depicts a recovery requiring an increase in turn rate by increasing g when already in an established angle of bank.<br>When the arrow points anywhere other than UP in the HUD (i.e., not along the lift vector, but perpendicular to the horizon), it may be accompanied by either a ″Roll Left (Right)″...″Roll Left (Right)″ or ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ voice warning. The voice warning indicates the correct initial response, then the aircrew should roll or pull as required to place or maintain the TAWS recovery arrow straight up in the HUD (i.e., along the lift vector). For example, if a ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ voice warning is issued with an accompanying HUD recovery HUD recovery arrow displayed in the HUD that is perpendicular to the horizon, the correct response is to roll left to align the lift vector with the HUD recovery arrow and then perform a dive recovery. If a ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ voice warning is issued with an accompanying HUD recovery arrow displayed in the HUD that is perpendicular to the horizon, the correct response is to apply g along the current lift vector and then, referencing the HUD recovery Figure 2-39.

            arrow, roll to align the lift vector with the HUD recovery arrow and perform a dive recovery. Figure 2-40 depicts a situation in which a roll or pull up aural warning could be issued. If a ″Roll Right...Roll Right″ aural warning was issued, a roll to the right would be the correct initial response and then a dive recovery would be continued with a longitudinal pull. If a ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ aural warning was issued, a longitudinal pull would be the correct initial response and then a roll to the right to align the lift vector with the HUD recovery arrow followed by a longitudinal pull for a dive recovery would be the follow-on recovery procedure.<br><br>. 2.17.4.4 HUD Reject 1. Reject 1 is enabled on non−night attack aircraft when the HUD is.<br><br>commanded to display a TAWS visual cue. In non−night attack aircraft, HUD write time limitations occur when the TAWS visual cue is displayed on the HUD. The write time limitation causes a loss of symbology. Enabling Reject 1 allows more important symbology to be displayed while less important symbology is not displayed.<br><br>. 2.17.4.5 ACI Configuration Check. There are three different ACI configurations in the F/A-18.<br><br>aircraft. Lot 9 and lower ACIs are not TAWS/GPWS compatible. Lot X and above can have either of two TAWS software loads: -1016 and -1018. The -1016 ACIs can command these four aural cues: ″Roll Out...Roll Out″, ″Pull Up...Pull Up″, ″Check Gear″, and ″Power...Power″. The -1018 and greater ACIs added logic for replacing the ″Roll Out...Roll Out″ aural cue with ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ and ″Roll Right...Roll Right″. Due to the variety of possible combinations, on cold start power-up, the MC commands a ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ to the ACI to determine if it is in the -1018 configuration. If there is no response, the MC commands a ″Roll Out...Roll Out″ to the ACI to determine if the ACI is in the . -1016 configuration. If no response is received the second time the MC attempts to command a ″RollOut...Roll Out″, the TAWS/GPWS voice warnings will not be heard with MC OFPs prior to 19C. With MC OFP 19C, the TAWS/GPWS voice warnings will be replaced by the ″Whoop...Whoop″ warning tone. In all cases, the visual arrow will still be present when a warning is issued. With MC OFP 19C, the ACI advisory is displayed on the DDI when the ACI does not pass the GPWS configuration check during MC cold start.<br><br>. 2.17.5 GPWS - Ground Proximity Warning System (MC OFP 10AA AND UP, 13C AND UP).

            The GPWS is executed by an algorithm within the mission computer OFP. It operates when MC1 is powered on. The GPWS option located on the A/C sublevel display allows the pilot to disable/enable the system. The GPWS option is reached by pressing MENU, HSI, DATA, A/C. The GPWS algorithm commands distinctive visual and aural cues to alert and direct recovery from an impending CFIT condition. All GPWS warnings should be treated as imminent flight into terrain, unless reassessed situational awareness dictates otherwise. Pilot response to a valid warning should be instinctive and immediate, using the maximum capabilities of the aircraft to recover until safely clear of terrain. The GPWS is inoperative with failed INS or ADC. It is recommended that the GPWS function be disabled to prevent false GPWS warnings during landing due to inaccurate vertical velocity.<br>GPWS has no forward looking or predictive capability. It provides no <br>protection under the following conditions:<br><br>. • RADALT, ADC, MC1 or INS off or failed.. • Transonic flight (0.95 to 1.04 IMN) outside the valid RADALT dataenvelope.<br>. • For 1.5 seconds after a break X is displayed.. • Less than 6 seconds after weight off wheels.. • Less than 5 seconds or greater than 120 seconds outside the validRADALT data envelope (± 50° pitch and AOB).<br>. • Dives greater than 50° after 2 minutes above 5,000 feet AGL.. • After a waveoff until exceeding a 1,000 fpm climb for 5 seconds.GPWS provides only limited protection and may not provide adequate <br>warning under the following conditions:<br><br>. • Rising terrain of greater than 2° slope.. • Coast mode (5 to 120 seconds outside valid RADALT envelope).With MC OFP 19C, full GPWS coverage is available when flying over level terrain at mean sea level.<br>. • Within GPWS defined LAT envelope (± 30° AOB, 0 to 30° dive, 450 to<br>560 KCAS).<br><br>. • Below 150 feet AGL and 200 KCAS.<br>. 2.17.5.1 Sensors/Modes. The GPWS is a look down system with no forward look capability. GPWS.<br><br>uses the RADALT, INS, and ADC, with the RADALT as the primary source of information for terrain clearance. RADALT data is considered valid by GPWS below 4,950 feet AGL and at a pitch or angle of bank less than 50°. Outside the valid RADALT data envelope, one of two options is used: 1) COAST mode: for level terrain protection continues after a 5-second delay for up to 2 minutes assuming a constant terrain elevation. With MC OFP 19C, full GPWS coverage is available when flying over level terrain at mean sea level. 2) BYPASS mode: for uneven terrain or while in the transonic region (Mach . 0.95 to Mach 1.04) GPWS is turned off to prevent nuisance cues. (Terrain with less than a 2° slope isdefined as level.) Full protection is resumed from both modes when valid RADALT data is restored.<br><br>. 2.17.5.2 CFIT Protection Provided - Altitude Loss During Recovery (ALDR).<br><br>Above 150 feet AGL - GPWS provides CFIT protection by continuously calculating, at current flight conditions, the altitude required to recover above the terrain.

GPWS calculates the altitude required for recovery from a pilot response time, a roll to wings level, and a dive recovery. The allowable pilot response time varies, depending on flight conditions, and is at a minimum (0.5 second) in the GPWS LAT envelope (±30° AOB, 0 to 30° dive, 450 to 560 knots). The altitude lost while rolling to wings level is based on a 1/2 to 3/4 lateral stick displacement roll at 1g. The altitude loss during the dive recovery is based on a target g onset rate and a target sustained g as shown below.<br>Target g Onset Rate Target Sustained g <br>Airspeed<400.<br><br>knots or AOB > 30° 80% of available g onset rate up to 5g/second 80% of g available up to 5g <br>Airspeed ≥400.<br><br>knots and AOB ≤ 30° 80% of available g onset rate up to 6g/second 90% of g available up to 6g <br>NOTE.<br><br>These g onset rates and sustained g levels require an aggressive pilot response.<br>Below 150 feet AGL - Protection is provided by warnings issued when current flight conditions could potentially result in CFIT.

(A waveoff is defined as 1000 fpm rate of climb for more than 5 seconds while below both 500 feet AGL and 200 knots.)

Computed data is supplied to the mission computer system, altitude reporting function of the IFF, engine controls, environmental control system, landing gear warning, and the fuel pressurization and vent system.<br>. 2.19.1 Angle-Of-Attack Probes. The left and right angle of attack probes are the airstream directionsensing units. Case heaters are on whenever electric power is on the aircraft. Probe heaters are on when airborne. The approach and indexer lights operate from signals from the airstream detection sensing units. The AOA probe outputs go only to the ADC and each FCC. The outputs are electrically independent, not mechanically independent. The probes can be damaged in such a way that they freeze in position and continue to send signals to the ADC and FCCs.

Most information is derived from BIT mechanizations within the avionic sets and from nonavionic built-in tests (NABIT) implemented in the computer software for other aircraft sub- systems.<br>The subsystem monitors engines and airframe operational status for unit failures and caution/ advisory conditions when the mission computer system is operating. When the mission computer system detects a caution/advisory condition, it commands display of the applicable caution or advisory message on one of the cockpit DDIs. If the mission computer system detects a unit failure, it commands the subsystem to store the applicable maintenance code. Stored maintenance codes can be reviewed on the aircraft maintenance indicator in the nose wheelwell, on the DDI MAINT BIT display in F/A-18A/B aircraft, and on the IFEI in F/A-18C/D aircraft. The mission computer (MC) displays the subsystem BIT results on one of the cockpit DDIs.<br>Non-BIT equipment status include DDI configuration display ID numbers and INS terminal data.<br><br>. 2.20.1 Flight Incident Recorder and Aircraft Monitoring Set (FIRAMS) (F/A-18C/D). The.<br><br>FIRAMS consists of a signal data computer, a data storage set, an integrated fuel/engine indicator and a maintenance status panel. It functionally replaces the AN/ASM-612 Signal Data Recording Set (SDRS), the AN/ACU-12/A engine performance indicator, and the fuel quantity indicators and fuel intermediate device. The FIRAMS monitors selected engine, airframe, avionic, nonavionic, fuel gauging and consumable signals. It also performs conversions of sensed measurands, provides real time clock function, outputs discrete and analog data to associated equipment, communicates with the mission computer, displays maintenance and status codes, and displays fuel quantities and engine parameters, including fuel system health monitoring. FIRAMS also provides nonvolatile storage for flight incident, maintenance, tactical and fatigue data.<br><br>. 2.20.2 Deployable Flight Incident Recorder Set (DFIRS) (Aircraft 164627 AND UP). The DFIRS.<br><br>system consists of the Deployable Flight Incident Recorder Unit (DFIRU), the data transfer interface unit, and the pyrotechnic release system. The SDR consists of the flight incident recorder memory, beacon, battery, and antenna, all contained in an deployable aerodynamic airfoil located on the top on the fuselage between the rudders. DFIRS stores up to 30 minutes of flight incident data and deploys this data along with a rescue beacon, via the airfoil, when activated. The SDR is deployed upon pilot ejection or ground/water impact. The data stored on the flight incident recorder (FIR) is gathered by the mission computer from existing systems on the aircraft. DFIRS records flight data, cautions, advisories, and spin data. The FIR memory wraps around to the beginning when the end of memory is reached. Only the last 30 minutes of each flight is retained. The MC controls the rate and the type of data that is stored. DFIRS data recording starts when both throttles are advanced past 90° power lever angle (PLA), when ground speed exceeds 50 knots, or when W off W and airspeed is over 80 knots.<br>DFIRS recording stops 1 minute after WOW, both throttles are less than 90° PLA, and the ground speed is less than 50 knots. All data during SPINs and MECH ON cautions are automatically recorded.<br>A DFIRS DWNLD option is available on the engine display. Selecting this option downloads the DFIRS data to the MU for easier retrieval.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-160.<br><br>

            . 2.20.2.1 Crash Survivable Flight Incident Recorder System (CSFIRS) (Aircraft 163427 THRU.<br><br><br>164279 AFTER AFC 258). The CSFIRS like the DFIRS is used to store data to aid in crash.<br><br>investigation. However, the CSFIRS is not deployable. The CSFIRS is attached to the aircraft and must be removed to retrieve crash data. CSFIRS is not installed in aircraft with DFIRS. The CSFIRS is located in the aft bay of the R LEX. The CSFIRS software emulates the DFIRS and records the same flight parameter data from the mission computer as the DFIRS. The CSFIRS can store up to 50 hours of flight data which can be retrieved by removing the CSFIRS and downloading to an MLVS. The CSFIRS also has the capability to download 30 minutes of flight data via the memory unit.<br><br>. 2.20.3 Avionic BIT. In most instances, two types of BIT are mechanized, periodic and initiated.<br><br>Periodic BIT begins functioning upon equipment power application. It provides a failure detection capability that is somewhat less than that provided by initiated BIT in that it does not interfere with normal equipment operation.<br>Two forms of BIT derived data are supplied to the MC. One form is validity information associated with selected data. The second form is the equipment failure information which identifies failed assemblies. The MC uses these two forms of BIT data to implement reversion operation and advisories for the pilot as well as equipment status displays for both the pilot and maintenance personnel.<br><br>. 2.20.3.1 Reversion. When the BIT equipment determines that a function has exceeded a predeter-.<br><br>mined threshold, the data derived from that function is immediately indicated as not valid. The MC, upon receiving this indication, reverts to the next best available source which in many cases is as <br>Figure 2-44.

            accurate as the original source. This reversion is maintained as long as the data remains invalid from the primary source.<br>Figure 2-44 illustrates this concept for the flight aids. For each unit in the primary path, there is at least one alternate source of data for reversion. The pilot is provided appropriate display cuing only when a reversion results in some loss of capability or performance. For example, if angle of attack is lost from the ADC, the MC reverts to FCS derived angle of attack. No display change or pilot cuing is made since the accuracy of the alternate source is equivalent to the primary source. If, however, the altitude switch is in RDR and the radar altimeter fails, the MC removes the displayed radar altitude, replaces it with barometric altitude, and indicates the barometric altitude display via cuing. If altitude is lost from the ADC and the altitude switch is in the BARO, the MC removes the displayed altitude from the HUD. These examples illustrate three forms of degraded mode advisories: (1) reversion to an alternate data source of equivalent accuracy with no pilot cuing; (2) reversion to an alternate data source of lesser accuracy with pilot cuing; (3) and removal of displayed data when no acceptable alternate source is available. Refer to Part VIII for further discussion on weapon system reversions.<br><br>. 2.20.3.2 Equipment Status Displays. Equipment status displays (BIT, caution, and advisory).<br><br>provide the pilot with continuous status of the avionics equipment and weapons. A cue to check equipment BIT status is the appearance of the BIT advisory display on either DDI or the HI/MPCD/AMPCD. The display is normally on the left DDI. A MENU selectable top level BIT format displays the status of failed, NOT RDY, or OFF systems of all avionics equipment which interface with the MC. When the BIT control display is selected on another display, the BIT advisory is removed until another BIT failure occurs.<br>Weapon and stores status is primarily displayed on the stores display (selected from the menu display). When the BIT display indicates a stores management system (SMS) failure, the affected stations and degree of failure are identified on the stores display as described in NTRP 3-22.4- FA18A-D and NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP. The BIT advisory and an SMS BIT status of DGD is the only enunciated indication of a stuck emergency jettison button.<br>Messages displayed as a function of equipment status are listed in the following table.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-164.<br><br>

The F/A-18 fly-by-wire flight control system uses redundant.<br><br>hardware to provide continued safe operation after component failures. The level of redundancy designed into the system was set by component failure rates, failure mode effects, aircraft mission time, and survivability considerations. The ability to provide safe operation is fundamentally based on the principle that there are no undetected (i.e. latent) failures prior to flight which would compromise system redundancy. It is not possible to have an in-flight Periodic BIT (PBIT) which can detect all degradations in a fly-by-wire system. Many redundant pathways can only be tested by setting system conditions that would be unsafe to establish in flight (e.g. verification of the ability to shut off an actuator). Preflight FCS initiated BIT was designed to provide those tests and thereby ensure the full redundancy of the flight control system is really available prior to flight. Without running Preflight FCS initiated BIT and performing the necessary maintenance, latent failures present in the system can result in unsafe conditions should additional failures occur in flight.<br>. 2.20.3.5.3 Preflight FCS initiated BIT Operation. Preflight initiated BIT consists of a series of testswhich verify the integrity of the flight control system processors, actuators, sensors, and cockpit interfaces. Preflight FCS initiated BIT begins by testing lower level functions first. If preflight FCS initiated BIT detects a fault at this level which affects higher level functions, it halts and reports the fault(s). If preflight FCS initiated BIT did not halt at this point, false BIT Logic INspect (BLIN) codes would be generated on higher level functions which depend upon the failed lower level function for their operation. If preflight FCS initiated BIT detects a fault in a subsystem (e.g. left stabilator), testing of the failed subsystem is discontinued, and testing of unrelated subsystems (e.g., rudders, trailing edge flaps, etc.) continues.<br>Since testing is not complete, preflight FCS initiated BIT must be run again after maintenance actions to complete all tests.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-172.<br><br>

            Flight with a BLIN code could result in a flight control system failure and aircraft loss. Pressing the FCS reset button simultaneously with the paddle switch does not correct BIT detected flight control system failures, it simply clears the BLIN code from the display. IBIT must be re-run after clearing BLIN codes to ensure the detected failures no longer exist. If BLIN codes remain following IBIT, the aircraft requires main- tenance to identify and correct failures in the flight control system.<br><br>. 2.20.3.5.4 Preflight FCS initiated BIT PASS/FAIL. A successful Preflight FCS initiated BIT results.<br><br>in a GO indication on the DDI. An unsuccessful Preflight initiated BIT indicates a system degradation.<br>There may not be an X on the DDI FCS status page (MENU-FCS) since the degradation may be in a backup path which is not active until after a primary system failure. Launching in a degraded state (i.e., with BLIN codes ) places the aircraft in a situation where a portion of the flight control system is operating without the normal redundancy.<br>. 2.20.3.5.5 Repetition of Preflight FCS initiated BIT. If an aircraft fails preflight FCS initiated BIT(i.e. BLIN codes present after preflight FCS initiated BIT) maintenance should be called to troubleshoot the system. After completing troubleshooting, a successful preflight FCS initiated BIT is necessary to ensure the system is fully operational. Except for cold weather operation, preflight FCS initiated BIT failure is indicative of a component degradation, i.e. hydraulic or electrical components are out of tolerance, or a cable conductor is intermittent (broken wire, loose connector pin, etc.) <br>. 2.20.3.5.6 Cold Weather and FCS Exerciser Mode. In cold weather, actuator components will not.<br><br>respond normally until hydraulic fluid temperature increases. Exerciser mode should be used to expedite monitors and system warm-up. During exerciser mode, a number of PBIT actuator monitors are ignored to prevent generation of nuisance BLIN codes. Thus in cold weather it is appropriate to re-attempt preflight BIT after running exerciser mode. Exerciser mode should not be used as a method to clear BLIN codes in normal start-up temperature conditions. BLINS cleared in this manner could be associated with hydraulic contamination or sticking control valves which could appear again in flight with catastrophic results.<br>Running exerciser mode in normal and hot weather environments may lead to hydraulic system overheat.<br><br>. 2.20.3.5.7 Running Preflight FCS Initiated BIT After Flight. A good (no codes) preflight BIT on the.<br><br>previous flight is no assurance against latent failures on the next flight. Electronic components have a propensity to fail on power application. Damage can occur during deck handling or maintenance activity not even associated with the flight controls. The only insurance is to run preflight BIT prior to flight.<br><br>. 2.20.3.6 SMS Initiated BIT. Safeguards have been built into the weapon system mechanization to.<br><br>allow SMS initiated BIT to be performed on the ground with weapons loaded and cartridges installed.<br>During initiated BIT, weapon release signals and associated circuitry are not exercised unless all of the following interlocks are satisfied simultaneously: master arm switch to ARM, armament safety override in override, weapon load codes on stores processor set to zero, and no weapon ID detected on any weapon station. SMS initiated BIT should not be attempted until the above interlocks are in a safe condition. The SMS initiated BIT should be successfully completed within 180 seconds of initiation.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-173.<br><br>

Selecting the INS/GPS option provides BIT options for the EGI. A CV or GND INS/GPS BIT commands the EGI to perform a short BIT on both the INS and GPS. A short EGI BIT tests system functionality. A long CV or GND INS/GPS BIT commands the EGI to perform a short BIT on the GPS and a long BIT on the INS.

The test pattern can then be compared on the four displays for similarity, and individually for concentricity, intensity level, and alphanumeric clarity. Pushbutton tests are accomplished by actuating the button.<br>A circle appears adjacent to the button when the functional test is successfully completed. In addition to displaying the DDI, HI/MPCD/AMPCD and HUD BIT test patterns, pressing the DSPL/EPI (IFEI)/UFC button initiates engine monitor indicator (EMI) and upfront control BIT checks. See figure 2-48.<br>Pressing the DSPL/EPI (IFEI)/UFC initiates BIT on three different equipment display groups. The following procedure can be used to test all groups simultaneously, or to test one or two of the display groups by performing the appropriate parts of the procedure. Regardless of whether the whole or a part of the procedure is required, the total time allowed for the test should be a minimum of 25 seconds. The EPI (IFEI) BIT display must be allowed to complete the described cycle before the BIT stop button is pressed. The reason for this is that when the DSPL/EPI (IFEI)/UFC BIT is initiated and the STOP button is pressed before the EPI (IFEI) BIT runs through to completion, the second half of the UFC BIT will be altered during the next test. If an alteration of the second half of the UFC BIT occurs, the problem might be cleared by running another EPI (IFEI) BIT to completion. The UFC would then test good during the next BIT check. The HI must be turned off during the UFC check or disruption of the UFC BIT results. On 161925 AND UP, running the BIT a minimum of 25 seconds and turning the HI off are not required.<br>. 1.

The.<br><br>same effect is also achieved by pressing MENU, although MENU is not available with the DSPL/EPI (IFEI)/UFC BIT test pattern displayed. When the STOP (or MENU) button is pressed, any test in progress stops and the equipment returns to normal operation. Exceptions to this are the radar and SMS power-on BIT and the COM 1/2, D/L, and tacan BIT. The radar and SMS power-on BIT cannot be terminated and, as such, indicates SF TEST when the MC detects the system is in BIT without having been commanded to do so. The same is true of the COM 1/2, D/L, and tacan equipment which performs a canned non-interruptable BIT sequence. The mission computer terminates initiated BIT for any equipment that it determined has taken too long to complete the test. For F/A-18 A/B, when DSPL/EPI (IFEI)/UFC initiated BIT is selected, the EPI (IFEI) display must be allowed to complete its display cycling before STOP is pressed or a UFC BIT failure is indicated.<br><br>. 2.20.3.11 BIT Logic Inspection (BLIN) Codes.

Both CUs are located in the aft crew station.<br><br>. 2.21.4 Magnetic Transmitter Unit (MTU). The MTU is used to generate a magnetic field used to.<br><br>determine HMD/AHMD position/orientation by the HMD MRU receiving the magnetic field and then sending the received signal to the EU. One MTU per cockpit is mounted on the canopy frame aft of the pilot/WSO’s left shoulder.<br>The MTU is energized when the HMD/AHMD is turned on. Warm-up time for the MTU is 15 to 20 minutes. System accuracy may drift up to 0.5° if the HMD/AHMD is aligned before MTU warm-up is completed. An additional 5 to 10 minutes should be added to the MTU warm-up time if operating in extremely cold temperatures (e.g., -40°C).<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>To maintain system accuracy, run initial HMD/AMHD alignment, or an additional HMD/AHMD alignment, after system is warmed-up.<br><br>. 2.21.5 Seat Position Sensor (SPS). The SPS is a linear potentiometer which indicates ejection seat.<br><br>height to the JHMCS. It is mounted to the aft right side of the ejection seat. There is one SPS for each ejection seat. This seat position information allows the JHMCS to compensate for disruption of the magnetic field in the cockpit as the metal in the seat changes position when the seat is raised or lowered.<br><br>. 2.21.6 HMD/AHMD OFF/BRT Knobs. The front cockpit HMD OFF/BRT knob is located on the spin.<br><br>recovery panel.

            . 2.21.12.2 FINE Alignment. When the FINE (PB 1) option is boxed an alignment cross is displayed.<br><br>in the HUD and two alignment crosses are displayed on the HMD in the vicinity of the HUD alignment is indicated (FA DXDY), the pilot moves the TDC either left or right to align in azimuth, up or down to align in elevation. The pilot presses and releases the cage/uncage switch when satisfied with the quality of the azimuth and elevation alignment. This causes the display to toggle to roll alignment mode. With the roll axis indicated (FA DROLL), TDC inputs to the left or right are used to rotate the HMD alignment symbols to align with the HUD alignment cross. The pilot presses and releases the cage/uncage switch when satisfied with the quality of the roll alignment. Pressing and releasing the cage/uncage switch continues to toggle between these two modes until the pilot deselects FINE to return to coarse alignment or exits alignment.<br>Upon entering fine alignment, automatically, or if commanded by the WSO selecting the FINE option, the EU indicates which axis is being aligned. If the azimuth and elevation axis is indicated, the WSO uses the DC to move the crosses up/down and left/right to align with the cross displayed on the BRU, figure 2-57, sheet 2. When satisfied with the alignment, the WSO presses and releases the undesignate switch on right hand controller at which time the EU automatically switches to roll alignment. The WSO uses the DC to rotate the cross so that it aligns with the cross displayed on the BRU. When satisfied with the quality of the alignment the WSO presses and releases undesignate switch on right hand controller.<br><br>. 2.21.12.3 Alignment Exit. Alignment is exited whenever ALIGN is deselected (unboxed), an A/A.<br><br>weapon is selected, MENU is selected, TDC priority is reassigned, ACM mode is selected, or the master mode is changed. This removes the alignment cross from the HUD, removes the FINE option, unboxes ALIGN, and returns the cage/uncage function to the previously assigned system.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALI-2-196.<br><br>

In the event of an EU failure which does not allow any symbology.<br><br>to be displayed on the HMD, the MC provides the radar boresight symbol and AIM-9 FOV symbol on the HUD. If the LOS is still valid, the MC continues to slave the radar or AIM-9 to the HMD LOS. If the LOS is invalid, the MC reverts to the current no-helmet mechanization for slaving weapons, sensors, and HOTAS.<br><br>. 2.21.17 Helmet Tracker Failure. If the EU reports that the helmet tracker is failed, or the helmet.<br><br>LOS is no longer valid, the MC discontinues slaving sensors and weapons to the HMD LOS. The MC replaces aircraft boresight for the helmet LOS to the radar and AIM-9. Additionally, the MC removes any item from the HMD which is tied to the HMD LOS.

These aircraft are tandem configured (see figure.<br><br>2-59) for performing the secondary role of a trainer without compromising the primary role of Fighter/Attack. Using the front cockpit controls, the F/A-18B/D avionics provide equivalent naviga- tion and weapon system capabilities as those available in the single-place F/A-18A/C. The rear cockpit controls duplicate most front cockpit controls for navigation and weapon system control. However, weapons cannot be launched/released/fired from the rear cockpit. The rear cockpit and the differences relative to the single-seat version are discussed in the following paragraphs.<br><br>. 2.22.2 F/A-18D Aircraft 163986 AND UP.<br><br><br>. 2.22.2.1 Night Attack Configuration. These aircraft are tandem configured with a primary role of.<br><br>performing the night attack mission. The rear cockpits of these aircraft have the stick and throttles removed. The rudder pedals are fixed and disconnected from the rudder, brakes, and nosewheel steering. Two hand controllers have been added and the rear cockpit controls and displays operate independent of the front cockpit. Instruments and lighting are NVG compatible.<br><br>. 2.22.2.2 Training Configuration. Night attack aircraft may be reconfigured to a trainer aircraft by.<br><br>removing the two hand controllers, adding throttles, stick, and connecting the rudder pedals. Rear cockpit controls and displays remain independent of the front cockpit.<br><br>. 2.22.2.3 RECCE Configuration. The F/A-18D aircraft, when retrofitted with the reconnaissance.<br><br>equipment, is designated as the F/A-18D(RC) (Reconnaissance Capable). It provides high resolution, long range standoff and overflight reconnaissance capabilities, for day or night, for all weather and under the weather missions. Electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors gather image data. Image data is recorded onto two onboard recorders and is available for downlink to ground stations for subsequent dissemination and exploitation. The aircraft is converted by installing the Advanced Tactical Reconnaissance System (ATARS) sensor suite into the nose bay in place of the 20 mm gun. A data link pod can be loaded on the centerline to allow for the downlink of imagery data. Refer to NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP for ATARS description and operating procedures.<br><br>. 2.22.3 Aircraft Dimensions. The approximate dimensions of the aircraft are as follows:<br><br>Span (Wings Spread) with missiles 40 feet 5 inches Span (Wings Spread) without missiles 37 feet 6 inches Span (Wings Folded) 27 feet 6 inches <br>Length 56 feet.<br><br>Height (To Top of Fins) 15 feet 3 inches Height (To Top of Closed Canopy) 11 feet 3 inches . 2.22.4 Aircraft Gross Weight.

The canopy system is similar to the F/A-18A/C aircraft except that an.<br><br>additional internal canopy jettison handle is installed in the rear cockpit. Note that the rear cockpit does not have an internal canopy switch or an internal manual canopy handcrank, and therefore, the canopy must be opened from the forward cockpit (or externally) unless it is jettisoned. To manually open the canopy using the internal manual handcrank, 224 counterclockwise manual crank turns are required. To manually open the canopy externally using a drivesocket, 112 counterclockwise manual crank turns are required.<br>. 2.22.7 Ejection Seat System. Ejection seats are installed in both cockpits.

The switch only operates with ac power on the aircraft.<br>TEST Serviceable warning/caution/advisory lights come on.<br>OFF The switch is spring loaded off.<br><br>. 2.22.9.8 Equipment Status Displays. In the aft cockpit, BIT, cautions and advisories are normally.<br><br>displayed on the left DDI. If the left DDI is unavailable, they are displayed on the right DDI.<br>On aircraft 163986 AND UP, if both rear cockpit DDIs are unavailable, the aft MPCD/AMPCD is used to display cautions and advisories. Cautions and advisories are displayed at the bottom of the display of the MPCD/AMPCD.<br><br>. 2.22.9.9 Master Caution Light. A yellow MASTER CAUTION light, on the upper instrument panel.<br><br>comes on whenever the MASTER CAUTION light in the forward cockpit comes on. The aft MASTER CAUTION light goes out whenever the front cockpit MASTER CAUTION is reset.<br><br>. 2.22.9.10 Landing Gear UNSFE Light. The red UNSFE light illuminates to indicate the landing gear.<br><br>is in transit and will also stay on if the gear does not match the handle position. The light does not indicate planing link failure, provide wheel warning, or air data computer failure indication.<br><br>. 2.22.9.11 Landing Gear Position Lights. There are three green landing gear position lights marked.<br><br>NOSE, LEFT, and RIGHT above the landing gear control handle. The lights come on when their respective gear is down and locked. The LEFT and RIGHT lights flash when their respective gear is down and locked but a related planing link is not locked.<br><br>. 2.22.9.12 Emergency Brake Handle. The emergency brake handle, on the left vertical panel, only.<br><br>provides emergency brakes. It has no parking brake function. To actuate the emergency brake system in either trainer or night attack aircraft configuration, pull out on the handle until it locks in the detent. The handle must be fully stowed to ensure anti-skid is available in either configuration.<br><br>. 2.22.9.13 Emergency Landing Gear Handle. The emergency landing gear handle, on the left vertical.<br><br>panel, provides emergency landing gear extension from the rear cockpit. Emergency extension is accomplished by pulling out on the handle until it locks in the detent. There are no provisions for normal landing gear extension.<br><br>. 2.22.9.14 Digital Display Indicators. On aircraft 161354 THRU 163778 the corresponding left and.<br><br>right DDI in each cockpit presents the same information. The center DDI displays the same information as the HI, except for the moving map display. Systems and presentations controlled by DDI/HI pushbuttons respond to the last action taken in either cockpit.<br>On aircraft 163986 AND UP the rear cockpit left and right DDI are independent of the front cockpit DDIs.

            . 2.22.9.23.2 Multifunction Switch (MFS). The switch is used for HARM sequence (forward),.<br><br>cage/uncage (aft), and raid/FOV (down). Refer to NTRP 3-22.4-FA18A-D and NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D for detailed operation.<br><br>. 2.22.9.23.3 TDC/DC Switch. In the aft cockpit, Designator Control (DC) priority is assigned to the.<br><br>DDI/MPCD/AMPCD. The MC initially assigns hand controller DC priority to left and right DDIs. The left DC (left hand controller) provides control of the format selected on either the left DDI or the MPCD/AMPCD. The right DC controller provides control of the format selected on either the right DDI or the MPCD/AMPCD. Right or left designator control of a format is based on the DC being assigned to the DDI/MPCD/AMPCD displaying a DC-compatible format, plus other logic as appropriate. MC inhibits right/left hand controller DC of the HUD format in the night attack aft cockpit.<br>Only one hand controller DC may be used to designate at a time, however both may be used simultaneously. TDC/DCs may be assigned to the same format in the front and rear cockpits; however, only one TDC/DC is processed at a time. When forward and aft TDC/DCs are assigned to the same format, both TDC/DCs must be within the deadband before a TDC/DC can become active. If a second TDC/DC is pressed out of deadband while the other TDC/DC is active, the second TDC/DC input is ignored. This also applies to the slew function.<br>The DC assignment diamond is flashed in the upper right corner of a format when a TDC/DC is assigned to the same format in both the forward and aft cockpits, and the MC is inhibiting one or both of the TDC/DCs from acting on the format because both TDC/DCs are pressed concurrently. SLEW is flashed if the above conditions are met for forward and aft DCs assigned to the same slew function.<br>In RECCE configured aircraft, the DC slews the MAG marker and roam magnified/unmagnified imagery, and expands/unexpands imagery.<br><br>. 2.22.9.23.4 Radar Elevation Control. The Radar Elevation Control (REC) switch is read by the.<br><br>DDI, provided to the MC, and passed to the radar as a radar elevation rate command. The radar processes the command and moves the radar antenna accordingly. The MC processes the hand controller RECs identically to the REC on the throttle in the forward cockpit. The MC processes only one REC at a time. All RECs must be within deadband before a REC can become active. If a second REC is selected while another REC is active, the second input is ignored.<br><br>. 2.22.9.23.5 Undesignate Button. The undesignate button is read by a DDI and passed to the MC.<br><br>The front cockpit undesignate button is read by the FCS and passed to the MC. The switches function identically except for HI-NWS situation with WOW. Since the front undesignate button is read and processed directly by the FCS, special case MC processing is not required.<br><br>. 2.22.9.23.6 Chaff/Flare/ECM Switch. The chaff/flare switch is wired directly to the ALE-39/.<br><br>ALE-47 chaff/flare set. Moving the right handcontroller chaff/flare switch forward causes a single chaff bundle to be dispensed. Moving the switch aft dispenses a single flare. Moving the left handcontroller ECM switch performs the countermeasures program dispense function in parallel with the dispense switches on the grab handle and the canopy sill DISP switch.<br><br>. 2.22.9.23.7 Push-to-Talk Foot Pedal Switches (F/A-18D night attack configured AIRCRAFT.<br><br><br>163986 AND UP). Comm 1 transmission is initiated by pressing the left foot pedal switch, Comm 2.<br><br>transmission is initiated by pressing the right foot pedal switch.

On Aircraft 163986 AND UP, two additional chaff/flare.<br><br>switches are located on either side of the grab handle. Each is a three-position momentary switch spring loaded to the center position and is designed to be thumb actuated while grasping the hand hold and looking aft. Each upward actuation of either switch commands a single chaff bundle to be dispensed. Each downward actuation of either switch commands a single flare to be dispensed.<br><br>. 2.22.9.26 ALE-39 Programmer. The ALE-39 programmer is installed on the rear cockpit left.<br><br>console. The programmer controls are normally preset by the ground crew.

On MIDS equipped night attack aircraft, the PTT COMM.<br><br>select panel is on the left console forward of the volume control panel. Three comm options are available: two Comm channels, two MIDS channels, or one Comm and one MIDS channel. The switch position determines push-to-talk foot pedal switch comm or MIDS operation.<br><br>. 2.22.9.28 Volume Control Panel. The volume controls (TCN, ICS, ECM, WPN, RWR, and after.<br><br>AFC 270 , VOX, MIDS A and B), on the volume control panel, provide the same functions for the rear cockpit headset as the corresponding volume controls on the front cockpit intercommunication panel provide for the front cockpit headset. The VOX control incorporates the hot and cold microphone switch functions that enables/disables cockpit microphone for intercom transmission in the cockpit where selected. The SAM volume control on aircraft 161354 THRU 161357 AND 161360 or the AUX volume control on aircraft 161704 AND UP are not used at the present time.<br><br>. 2.22.9.29 Azimuth Indicator.

            begun, advance throttles to MIL power and check EGT and RPM. If an afterburner takeoff is desired, afterburner is selected by moving both throttles into the afterburner range and advancing smoothly to MAX power. If one afterburner fails to light or blows out during takeoff, the resulting power loss is significant. Sufficient directional control is available with the rudder and nosewheel steering to continue the takeoff with asymmetric power. The decision to abort or continue the takeoff depends on existing circumstances: external stores configuration, runway remaining, and the characteristics of the afterburner failure since it may indicate problems with the basic engine. Nosewheel steering is used to maintain directional control throughout the takeoff roll. Differential braking alone may not be adequate to maintain directional control on takeoff. Also, the drag of the brakes increases the length of the takeoff roll.<br>The location of the main landing gear well aft of the CG does not allow the aircraft to be rotated early in the takeoff roll. The normal rotation technique is to position the stick aft of neutral approaching nosewheel lift-off speed. Nosewheel lift-off speed depends on weight and CG, however, hold the aft stick until 6° to 8° nose high attitude (waterline symbol) is reached. Main gear lift-off follows shortly, and a forward adjustment of stick is necessary to maintain the desired attitude.<br>For a minimum run takeoff, use full afterburner power. Approaching nosewheel lift-off speed, apply full aft stick until the aircraft begins to rotate. Adjust the stick to maintain a 10° to 12° nose high attitude (waterline symbol). Once a positive climb rate is established, ensure the gear handle light is out and retract the gear. Accelerate to the appropriate climb speed.<br><br>Figure 7-1.

Enter the pattern as prescribed by local course rules. At the break,reduce thrust and extend the speedbrake (if required). As the airspeed decreases through 250 knots, lower the landing gear and place the FLAP switch to FULL and ensure that speedbrake is retracted.<br>Retract speedbrake, if extended. Decelerate to on-speed, and compare airspeed and angle of attack.<br>Complete the landing checklist. Roll into the base leg and establish a rate of descent, maintaining on-speed AOA. On-speed without external stores and 2,000 pounds of internal fuel is about 125 knots.<br>Add about 2.5 knots for each 1,000 pounds increase in fuel and stores. Rate of descent can be established using the velocity vector on the HUD to set the glide-slope. Avoid overcontrolling the throttles as thrust response is immediate. Compensate for crosswind by crabbing the aircraft into the wind on final approach.<br>. 1. LAND checklist - COMPLETE<br>. 7.3.3 Touchdown.<br><br>Maintain approach attitude and thrust setting to touchdown using the lens or make a firm touchdown at least 500 feet past the runway threshold. At touchdown, place the throttles to IDLE. The aircraft tends to align itself with the runway. Small rudder corrections (NWS) may be required to keep the aircraft tracking straight. Using a flared minimum descent rate landing, the WOW switch may not actuate immediately. In this case, the throttles cannot be reduced to ground idle and may be inadvertently left in the flight idle position, thereby reducing the deceleration rate and extending the length of the landing rollout. Track down the runway centerline using rudder pedals to steer the aircraft. Aerodynamic braking is not recommended. Getting the nosewheel on the ground and use of aft stick (programmed in by light braking and slowly pulling the stick aft after touchdown so only the minimum required distance to command full aft stabilator deflection by 100 knots) provides faster deceleration from the stabilators and more directional control with use of the NWS.<br>Commanding full aft stick deflection with the ejection seat within 1.75 inches of the top limit can cause the lower ejection handle to snag on the air-to-air weapon select switch and result in inadvertent ejection. In particular, during stabilator braking after a full stop landing the control stick should be pulled back only the minimum required distance to command full stabilator authority. Inadvertent ejections have occurred after stabilator braking when the pilot has released full aft stick.<br><br>. 7.3.4 Nosewheel Steering.

            ineffective below an airspeed of 75-85 knots. Differential braking requires special attention and technique to control the aircraft below this speed. NWS is activated automatically in the low mode (16° limit) by weight on the nose and at least one main gear. NWS inputs are commanded through force sensors behind the minimum displacement rudder pedals allowing for precise directional control. The NWS does not receive commands through the rolling surface to rudder interconnect (RSRI).<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Rudder and vertical tail effectiveness is significantly reduced if the speedbrake is extended during the landing rollout and degrades directional control during crosswind landings. Aircraft directional stability is further reduced on a wet runway.<br>The aircraft can be safely landed with the nosewheel steering failed (castering) in crosswinds up to 25 knots. The aircraft tends to drift more to the downwind side of the runway and corrections are more difficult. With the anti-skid on, directional control with differential brakes require pumping of the upwind brake or releasing pressure from the downwind brake. To reduce the risk of blowing the tires, landing without anti-skid on when heavy braking is anticipated is not recommended.<br>Engaging the high gain mode of NWS while maintaining a rudder pedal input causes a large nosewheel transient and may cause loss of directional control.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Using the high gain mode of nosewheel steering (NWS HI) during the landing rollout is not recommended and may lead to directional pilot induced oscillations due to the increased sensitivity of the NWS to rudder pedal inputs.<br><br>. 7.3.5 Landing Rollout. Track down the runway centerline using rudder pedals to steer the aircraft.<br><br>directionally. Aerodynamic braking is not recommended. Use wheel braking only after the aircraft main wheels are firmly on the runway.<br><br>. 7.3.6 Braking Technique. Under normal circumstances, the best results are attained by applying.<br><br>moderate to heavy braking with one smooth application of increasing braking pressure as airspeed decelerates towards taxi speed. Anti-skid is effective down to approximately 40 KGS. Below 40 KGS, heavy brake pedal pressure should be relaxed to prevent tire skid. Below 35 KGS, steady but firm brake pedal pressure should be applied. Steady, light brake applications should be avoided, as they increase brake heating, do not significantly contribute to deceleration, and ultimately reduce braking effectiveness. If desired, selecting aft stick (up to full) below 100 KCAS will increase TEU stabilator <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-7-28.<br><br>

            deflection and aid in deceleration. Full aft stick increases down force on the main landing gear, as well as significantly increasing drag due to large stabilator size.<br>Recommended braking speeds are based on tests conducted at sea level.<br>Ground speed may be significantly higher than calibrated airspeed at airfields above sea level. Aircrew should consider available runway length and field elevation to evaluate wheel brake usage and landing rollout distance to avoid excessive brake heat build-up and subsequent tire deflation or wheel assembly fire when landing at airfields above sea level.<br>Maximum braking performance is attained by applying full brake pedal pressure (approximately 125 lb) immediately after touchdown. Anti-skid must be on to attain maximum braking performance and to reduce the risk of a blown tire. Longitudinal pulsing may be felt as the anti-skid cycles. Approaching <br>40 KCAS, full brake pedal pressure should be relaxed to prevent tire skid.<br><br><br>. 7.3.7 Crosswind Landing. The optimum technique for crosswind landing is to fly a crabbed.<br><br>approach, taking out half the crab just before touchdown. For landing in a crosswind greater than 15 knots on a dry runway, the touchdown should be slightly cushioned in order to reduce landing gear trunion loads. The wing-down top-rudder technique is ineffective in crosswinds greater than 20 knots, creates excessive pilot workload, and should not be used. Touchdown in a full crab or with all the crab taken out may cause large directional oscillations which can lead to excessive pilot inputs and subsequent PIO. Taking out half the crab provides the correct amount of pedal force and resultant NWS command to start the aircraft tracking down the runway.<br>When calculating crosswind components for takeoff or landing, use the full value of any reported gusts in your calculations.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Pilot control inputs are not required to counter slightly objectionable directional oscillations which may occur at and immediately following touchdown. Minimize stick and rudder pedal inputs until nose movement is stable. If oscillations continue, execute a go-around.<br>Subsequent runway centerline tracking requires only small rudder inputs to initiate directional corrections. Although lateral stick is not generally required during the landing roll, judicious inputs may be made to counter the upwind wing rocking up. Landing rollouts in crosswinds up to 30 knots have been accomplished with hands off the control stick with little or no objectionable roll (less than 5°) induced by crosswind or asymmetric stores.<br><br>. 7.3.8 Wet Runway Landing. The aircraft exhibits satisfactory handling characteristics during.<br><br>landing rollouts on wet runways. However, experience indicates that landing in crosswind conditions may increase the pilot tendency to directionally overcontrol the aircraft during the landing rollout. Wet runways can induce hydroplaning throughout the landing rollout. As a result, the aircraft may respond sluggishly to NWS commands and encourage the pilot to use excessively large control inputs.

            pedal commands should be kept small, especially if hydroplaning is suspected. Minimum total hydroplaning speed of the main landing gear tires inflated to 250 psi is 140 knots groundspeed and, for nose gear tires inflated to 150 psi, is 110 knots. However, some hydroplaning can occur at much lower speed, depending upon runway conditions. For wet (standing water) runway landings, reduce gross weight to minimum practical. Concentrate on landing ON SPEED or slightly slow with power coming off at touchdown. Maintain a constant attitude and sink rate to touchdown. Ensure the throttles are in ground idle. When comfortable with directional control, use maximum anti-skid braking to minimize landing distance. Go around if a directional control problem occurs and make an arrested landing.<br>Delaying the decision to abort the landing and go around can put the pilot in a situation in which he cannot remain on the runway during the takeoff attempt.<br>Landing with significant standing water on runway has caused water ingestion which in extreme cases can cause engine stalls, flameouts, A/B blowouts, and/or engine FOD. Avoid standing water in excess of 0.25 inch.<br><br>. 7.3.9 Asymmetric Stores Landing. Landing with asymmetric external stores up to 12,000 foot-.<br><br>pounds of lateral asymmetry requires no special considerations. Above 12,000 foot-pounds of lateral asymmetry, AOA must be kept below 12° to prevent uncommanded sideslip.<br>The inboard station is 7.3 feet from the aircraft centerline and the outboard station is 11.2 feet from the aircraft centerline. A lateral asymmetry of 12,000 foot-pounds occurs with 1,636 pounds of asymmetry on an inboard station or 1,070 pounds of asymmetry on an outboard station.<br>Due to landing gear structural limitations, the weight of an asymmetric tip missile and/or internal wing fuel asymmetry must be used in calculating total aircraft asymmetry. Asymmetry due to internal wing fuel imbalance is calculated by multiplying the difference of fuel weight between left hand and right hand wing by 8.0 feet. Fuel weight differences of less than 100 pounds are considered negligible.<br>Wingtip missile asymmetries can be calculated by multiplying missile weight by 19.5 feet (the distance of the wingtip station from aircraft centerline.) If lateral asymmetry exceeds 12,000 foot-pounds, do not exceed 12° AOA. Recommend fly straight-in approach at optimum approach speed. Do not apply cross controls and make only smooth, coordinated rudder and lateral stick inputs. In a crosswind, fly a crabbed approach to touchdown.<br>Field landings (flared) with asymmetries between 17,000 and 26,000 foot-pounds are authorized only at touchdown sink rates up to 500 fpm due to structural limitations of the landing gear.<br>. 7.3.10 Waveoff. Do not delay the decision to take a waveoff to the point that control of the landingor rollout is in jeopardy. Takeoff distances at MIL or MAX power are short provided the aircraft has not decelerated to slow speed. Advance the throttles to MIL or MAX as required to either stop the sink rate or takeoff and maintain angle of attack. Raise the landing gear and flaps only after a safe climb has been established.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-7-30.<br><br>

            . 8.1.2 Carrier INS Environment. The CV alignment is dependent on the Ship Inertial Navigation.<br><br>System (SINS). Align times are longer to achieve QUALs typical on land. Ship turns and sea-state also affect the CV alignment. Postflight updates (closeout) cannot be performed on carriers.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>It is recommended that a waypoint zero position (SINS, PIM, etc.) be input to reduce GPS satellite acquisition time.<br><br>. 8.2 DAY OPERATIONS.<br><br><br>. 8.2.1 Preflight. When directed to man the aircraft, conduct a normal preflight inspection with.<br><br>particular attention given to the landing gear, struts, tires, arresting hook, and underside of the fuselage for possible arresting cable damage. Ensure sufficient clearance exists for cycling ALL control surfaces. Interior checks are the same as shore based except anti-skid OFF. Note the relationship of the APU exhaust port and the arresting hook to the deck edge. Do not start the APU if there is a possibility of damage from the APU exhaust. Do not lower the hook during post start checks unless the hook point will drop on the flight deck.<br>The maximum wind allowed for canopy opening is 60 knots. Attempting canopy opening in headwinds of more than 60 knots or in gusty or variable wind conditions may result in damage to or loss of the canopy.<br><br>. 8.2.2 Engine Start. When directed, start engines. APU starts should be made whenever possible.<br><br>Crossbleed starts must be approved by the Air Boss due to the relatively high power setting required, and the potential for injury from the jet blast.<br>Perform the before taxi checks and be ready to taxi when directed.<br><br>. 8.2.3 Taxi.<br><br>. • Ensure anti-skid switch is OFF for all carrier operations.. • Wait 5 seconds after wings are fully spread before placing the WINGFOLD handle to LOCK. Placing the WING FOLD handle to LOCK before the wings are fully spread removes the WING UNLK caution even through the wings are not fully spread and cause severe damage to the wing fold transmission.<br>The wingfold control handle should smoothly go into the LOCK position.<br>Forcing the handle could cause damage to the wingfold system.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-8-2.<br><br>

            Due to the high wind over the deck, it is possible for the aileron locking pin to shear at any time. This will allow the aileron to fair away from the neutral position. Pay special attention to the aileron position with the wings folded on the carrier deck. To avoid damaging the flaps, ensure ailerons are not faired inboard prior to raising the flaps, conducting IBIT, or running FCS exerciser. Proper aileron position can be determined either visually or by verifying an aileron position of 0 or down arrow on the FCS page.<br>Taxiing aboard ship is much the same as ashore, but increased awareness of jet exhaust and aircraft directors are mandatory.<br>Nosewheel steering is excellent for directional control aboard ship. Taxi speed should be kept under control at all times, especially on wet decks, in the landing area, and approaching the catapult. The canopy should be down, oxygen mask on, and the ejection seat armed during taxi. Be prepared to use the emergency brake should normal braking fail. In the event of loss of brakes, inform the tower and lower the tailhook immediately to indicate brake loss to the deck personnel.<br><br>. 8.2.4 Hangar Deck Operation. Occasionally the aircraft is manned on the hangar deck. Follow the.<br><br>same procedures as those concerning flight deck operation.<br>Tiedowns shall not be removed from the aircraft unless emergency brake accumulator pressure gauge indicates at least 2,600 psi. The emergency brake shall be used for stopping the aircraft anytime it is being moved while the engines are not running. If the aircraft is not already on the elevator, it will be towed or pushed (with the pilot in the cockpit) into position to be raised to the flight deck. Close the canopy, ensure tiedowns are in place, and put the parking brake on anytime the aircraft is on the elevator.<br>The signal to stop an aircraft that is being towed is either a hand signal or a whistle blast. The whistle signifies an immediate or emergency stop. Leave the canopy open and helmet off to ensure hearing the whistle; keep the plane director in sight at all times. If unable to see the plane director, or if in doubt of safe aircraft movement, stop the aircraft immediately.<br>. 8.2.5 Before Catapult Hook-Up. Before taxi onto the catapult, complete the takeoff checklist, set thestandby attitude reference indicator for use if the HUD fails during the launch. With flaps HALF or FULL, the takeoff trim button should be pressed until the TRIM advisory appears and then the horizontal stabilator trim should be manually positioned for CG location, excess end airspeed and power setting for launch. The takeoff trim button need not be pressed between successive launches in a single flight. With an asymmetric load, trim stabilator for normal position then trim differential stabilator unloaded wing down. The trim settings in figure 8-1 are applicable for HALF flaps only, all air-to-air stores, air-to-ground stores, clean aircraft, external fuel tanks, gross weights and launch CG between 17.0 and 27.5% MAC. For normal operation, 15 knots excess end airspeed above minimum is recommended.<br>Correct stabilator trim is critical to aircraft hands off fly-away performance. Stabilator trim affects initial pitch rate and determines AOA capture. A low trim setting both lowers the initial pitch rate below optimum and causes the aircraft to fly away in a flatter attitude due to a lower than optimum AOA capture. This results in degraded climb performance after launch. A higher than recommended trim setting can cause excessive AOA overshoots which can lead to loss of lateral directional control when loaded with asymmetric stores, or in a single engine emergency.<br>Use of catapult 4 is restricted with certain stores loaded on station 2.<br>Refer to applicable launch bulletin.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-8-3.<br><br>

Before taxiing past the shuttle, aircraft gross weight should be verified,.<br><br>takeoff checklist complete, and arming completed by the ordnance crew if required. Check external fuel quantity. Approach the catapult track slowly, lightly riding the brakes, with nosewheel steering on.<br>Use minimum power required to keep the aircraft rolling. Close attention to the plane director’s signals is required to align the aircraft with the catapult track entry wye. When aligned, the plane director signals the pilot to lower the launch bar. Place the launch bar switch to EXTEND. The green LAUNCH BAR advisory light comes on and nosewheel steering disengages. Nosewheel steering low mode may be engaged while the launch bar is down by pressing and holding the nosewheel steering button. This should only be done on signal from the director since catapult personnel may be in close proximity to the launch bar. Do not use nosewheel steering once the launch bar enters the track. The catapult crew installs the holdback bar and the aircraft may taxi forward slowly, following the signals of the plane director. When the launch bar drops over the shuttle spreader, the aircraft will be stopped by the holdback bar engaging the catapult buffer. On aircraft 161353 THRU 161715, upon receipt of the “Release Brakes” signal, advance throttles to 85% to 90% rpm. Do not advance throttles to MIL at this time since this could retract the launch bar before it is trapped by the tensioned shuttle spreader.

Military power launches minimize the impact of sustained afterburner operation on the ship’s jet blast deflectors (JBDs) and reduce fuel consumption. Afterburner catapults improve aircraft sink-off-bow performance and single engine flyaway performance in case of an emergency. Stabilizing in military power while in catapult tension and selecting afterburner (MIL/ MAX setting) at holdback release provides a compromise between single engine climb capability, fuel consumption and JBD compatibility. Performing a MIL to MAX afterburner transient results in only a small reduction of engine stall margin. If afterburner thrust is to be selected during the catapult stroke, advance throttles to MAX immediately following catapult holdback release. This maximizes the available time for the engines to stabilize prior to the end of the catapult stroke. The catapult settings for a MIL/MAX shot are identical to a MIL power shot, so there is no need for pilots to communicate their intention to exercise the MIL/MAX option to the catapult crew.<br><br>CATAPULT THROTTLE SETTINGS.<br><br><br>Weight Board Engine Power.<br><br>44,000 lbs and below <br>MIL.<br><br><br>MIL/MAX.<br><br><br>MAX.<br><br>45,000 lbs and above MAX <br>NOTE.<br><br>. • MIL/MAX power setting is defined as stabilizing in military powerwhile in catapult tension, and selecting maximum afterburner at holdback release.<br>. • Any engine experiencing self-clearing pop stalls due to steam ingestionduring the catapult launch indicates the engine is operating at near the limits of available stall margin.

On aircraft 161353 THRU 161715, the launch bar switch automatically returns to RETRACT and the green LAUNCH BAR advisory light goes out. On aircraft 161716 AND UP, place the launch bar switch to RETRACT. Cycle the flight controls, wait 4 seconds then ensure all warning and caution lights are out.

PIO can occur immediately after launch if the control stick is restrained during the launch or control inputs are made immediately after launch.

            recommended trim settings of paragraph 8.2.5 are designed to minimize aircraft sink-off-bow while maintaining AOA low enough so that lateral directional controllability is sufficient in the event of an engine failure. Normal catapult launches are characterized by an initial rotation as high as 13° AOA before AOA and pitch rate feedbacks reduce the AOA to the reference value. A range of 10 to 12° AOA is the optimum compromise between minimizing sink-off-bow and ensuring controllability in the event of an engine failure.<br>F/A-18 catapult launch endspeeds are determined by one of two limiting factors, single engine minimum control airspeed and sink-off-bow. At gross weights of 45,000 lbs and above, the minimum launch endspeed ensures that the aircraft will not sink excessively during the catapult flyaway. With normal endspeed (11 to 20 knots above minimum) and deck conditions, 4 to 6 feet of settle can be expected. The pilot perceives the catapult shot to be level, as the rotation of the aircraft keeps the pilot’s eye approximately level, even though the aircraft center-of-gravity sinks. With zero excess endspeed, up to 20 feet of settle can be expected. For heavy weight shots which are planned with 10 knots or less excess endspeed, trim settings are increased 3° to help minimize the settle that will occur.<br>This higher trim setting comes at the cost of reducing the margin of controllability should an engine fail. Therefore, the higher trim settings should only be used when advised by the ship that the shot will definitely have 10 knots or less excess endspeed. The higher trim settings bias the compromise between aircraft controllability and minimizing settle to favor minimizing settle, because in the case of a planned reduced endspeed shot, excessive settle is definitely going to occur, while the chance of an engine failure is no different than any other shot.<br>At gross weights of 44,000 lbs and below, the minimum launch endspeed is determined by the single engine minimum control airspeed. This endspeed is greater than the speed required to minimize sink-off-bow for that weight range. Therefore, catapult shots in this regime are characterized by greater climb rates than catapult shots at weights of 45,000 lbs and above. Little to no sink should be observed for nominal endspeed and deck conditions when launched at 44,000 lbs and below.<br>The single engine minimum control airspeed increases as asymmetry increases. Minimum launch endspeeds for weight boards of 37,000 lbs and above ensure sufficient airspeed to maintain aircraft control for asymmetric loadings up to and including 22,000 ft-lbs. For weight boards of 36,000 lbs and below, airspeed is only sufficient to guarantee controllability for up to 6,000 ft-lbs of asymmetry.<br>Aircraft being launched at these weights must not exceed the 6,000 ft-lb asymmetry limit.<br><br>. 8.2.9 Catapult Suspend. To stop the launch while tensioned on the catapult, signal by shaking the.<br><br>head negatively and transmitting SUSPEND, SUSPEND on land/launch frequency. Do not use a thumbs down signal or any hand signal that might be mistaken for a salute. The catapult officer replies with a SUSPEND signal followed by an UNTENSION AIRPLANE ON CATAPULT signal. The shuttle spreader is moved aft and the launch bar automatically raises clear of the shuttle spreader.<br>Maintain power at MIL/MAX until the catapult officer steps in front of the aircraft and signals THROTTLE BACK. The same signals are used when a catapult malfunction exists.<br><br>. 8.2.10 Landing Pattern.

            While maneuvering to enter the traffic pattern, attempt to determine the sea state. This information will be of value in predicting problems that may be encountered during the approach and landing.<br>Enter the carrier landing pattern (figure 8-2) with the hook down. Make a level break from a course parallel to the Base Recovery Course (BRC), close aboard to the starboard of the ship. Below 250 knots lower the gear and flaps. Descend to 600 feet when established downwind and prior to the 180° position. Complete the landing checklist and crosscheck angle-of-attack and proper airspeed. Pitch trim is set to 8.1° AOA when autopilot is disengaged while in the PA configuration if AOA is greater than 6.0°.<br>With a 30-knot wind over the deck begin the 180° turn to the final approach when approximately abeam the LSO platform. When the meatball is acquired, transmit “Call sign, Hornet, Ball or CLARA, fuel state (nearest 100 pounds) and auto” (if using ATC for approach). Refer to figure 8-3 for a typical <br>Carrier Controlled Approach.<br><br><br>. 8.2.11 ATC Approach Mode Technique. The ATC approach mode should be engaged with the.<br><br>aircraft near on-speed. If fast when ATC is engaged, additional time may be required for on-speed capture. The technique required for an ATC approach mode differs from a manual approach in that all glideslope corrections are made by changing aircraft attitude. Since this technique violates the basic rule that altitude/glideslope is primarily controlled by the throttle, practice is required to use ATC. For the ATC to perform satisfactorily, smooth attitude control is essential. Large attitude changes result in divergent glideslope oscillations or overcontrolling power response. Close-in corrections are very critical. If large attitude correction for a high-in-close situation develops, the recommended procedures is to stop ball motion and do not attempt to recenter it. A low-in-close condition is difficult to correct with ATC and usually results in an over-the-top bolter. It may be necessary to manually override ATC in order to safely recover from a low-in-close condition. The force required to manually disengage ATC is significant and may prevent salvaging the pass. Throughout the approach the pilot should keep his hand on the throttles in the event it is necessary to manually disconnect/override the ATC.<br>. 8.2.12 Glideslope. The technique for flying the glideslope is basically the same as FCLP except thatmore power may be required to maintain glideslope, and line-up will be much harder to maintain. With rough seas and a pitching deck some erratic ball movement may be encountered. If this is the case, listen to the LSO’s calls and average out the balls movement to maintain a safe controlled approach.<br><br>. 8.2.13 Waveoff. When the waveoff signal is received, immediately apply military/afterburner power.<br><br>and effect a slight nose rotation to stop the rate of descent. During an in-close waveoff, excessive rotation by the pilot will cause a cocked-up or over-rotated attitude which can result in an inflight engagement and possible aircraft damage.<br>Selecting afterburner during an ‘‘in close’’ or a technique waveoff, produces limited performance gains. FULL flap approach airspeed is essentially the same as the single engine afterburner minimum controllable airspeed. The asymmetric thrust from an asymmetric afterburner light-off of either the . -400 or -402 engines during a ‘‘high coming down’’ or a ‘‘slow’’ approach may result in unacceptable yawcontrol and significant lineup deviations. Unintentional arrestment may result in damage to the aircraft and arresting gear.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-8-9.<br><br>

            . 8.3.2 Preflight. Conduct the exterior preflight using a white lensed flashlight. Ensure that the.<br><br>exterior lights are properly positioned for launch and the external lights master switch OFF before engine start. Ensure that instrument and console light rheostats are on. This reduces brilliance of the warning and advisory lights when the generators come on.<br><br>. 8.3.3 Before Taxi. Adjust cockpit lighting as desired and perform before taxi checks.<br><br><br>. 8.3.4 Taxi. Slow and careful handling by aircraft directors and pilots is mandatory. If any doubt.<br><br>exists as to the plane director’s signals, stop the aircraft. At night it is very difficult to determine speed or motion over the deck; rely on the plane director’s signals and follow them closely.<br><br>. 8.3.5 Catapult Hook-Up. Maneuvering the aircraft for catapult hook-up at night is identical to that.<br><br>used in day operations; however, it is difficult to determine speed or degree of motion over the deck.<br><br>. 8.3.6 Catapult Launch. On turn-up signal from the catapult officer, ensure throttles are in MIL or.<br><br>MAX and check all instruments. Ensure that launch bar switch is in the retract position. When ready for launch, place external lights master switch ON.<br>All lights should be on bright with the strobes on. If expecting to encounter instrument meteoro- logical conditions shortly after launch, the strobes may be left off at the discretion of the pilot.<br>After launch, monitor rotation of the aircraft to 12° nose up crosschecking all instruments to ensure a positive rate of climb. When comfortably climbing, retract the landing gear and flaps and proceed on the departure in accordance with ship’s procedures. The standby attitude reference indicator should be used in the event of a HUD failure.<br>. 8.3.7 Aircraft or Catapult Malfunction. If a no-go situation arises, do not turn on the exterior lightsand transmit SUSPEND, SUSPEND. Maintain MIL/MAX power until the catapult officer walks in front of the wing and gives the throttle-back signal. If the external lights master switch has been placed on prior to ascertaining that the aircraft is down, transmit SUSPEND, SUSPEND and turn off the exterior lights and leave the throttles at MIL until signaled to reduce power.<br><br>. 8.3.8 Landing Pattern. Night and instrument recoveries normally are made using case III procedures.<br><br>in accordance with the CV NATOPS Manual.<br><br>. 8.3.9 Arrestment and Exit From the Landing Area. During the approach all exterior lights should.<br><br>be on with the exception of taxi/landing light. Following arrestment, immediately turn the external lights master switch off. Taxi clear of the landing area following the plane director’s signals.<br><br>. 8.4 SECTION CCA.<br><br>A section CCA may be necessary in the event a failure occurs affecting navigation aids, communi- cations equipment, or other aircraft systems.<br>Normally, the aircraft experiencing the difficulty flies the starboard wing position during the approach. The section leader detaches the wingman when the meatball is sighted and continues straight ahead, offsetting as necessary to the left to determine if the wingman lands successfully. Lead shall continue descending to not lower than 300 feet and turn on all lights to bright and strobes on. This provides the wingman with a visual reference in the event of a bolter or waveoff. The wingman should not detach until the meatball is in sight. If the wingman fails to arrest, the leader begins a climb to 1,200 feet or remains VFR at 150 knots during the rendezvous, but in no case should a rendezvous be attempted below non-precision minimums.

            CHAPTER 9.<br><br><br>Special Procedures.<br><br><br>. 9.1 FORMATION FLIGHT.<br><br><br>. 9.1.1 Formation Taxi/Takeoff. During section taxi, ensure adequate clearance between flight lead’s.<br><br>stabilator and wingman’s wing/missile rail is maintained. For formation takeoff, all aspects of the takeoff must be prebriefed by the flight leader. This should include flap settings, use of nosewheel steering, power changes, power settings, and signals for actuation of landing gear, flaps, and afterburner. The leader takes position on the downwind side of the runway with other aircraft in tactical order, maintaining normal parade bearing. See figure 9-1. For three-aircraft formations, line up with the lead on the downwind side, number 2 on the centerline, and number 3 on the upwind side.<br>Wingtip/launch rail overlap should not be required but is permitted if necessary. For four-plane formations, line up with the lead’s section on the downwind half of the runway and other section on the upwind half. After Before Takeoff checks are completed and the flight is in position, each pilot looks over the next aircraft to ensure the speedbrake is retracted, the flaps are set for takeoff, all panels are closed, no fluids are leaking, safety pins are removed, rudders are toed-in, nosewheel is straight and the launch bar is up. Beginning with the last aircraft in the flight, a “thumbs up” is passed toward the lead to indicate “ready for takeoff”.<br><br>. 9.1.1.1 Section Takeoff. Engines are run up to approximately 80%, instruments checked, and.<br><br>nosewheel steering low gain ensured. On signal from the leader, brakes are released, throttles are advanced to military power minus 2% rpm. If afterburner is desired, the leader may go into mid range burner immediately without stopping at military power. Normal takeoff techniques should be used by the leader, with the wingman striving to match the lead aircraft attitude as well as maintain a position in parade bearing with wingtip separation. The gear and flaps are retracted on signal. Turns into the wingman are not to be made at altitudes less than 500 feet above ground level. When both sections begin takeoff roll from the same point on the runway, the second section must delay takeoff roll until 10 seconds after the first section starts the takeoff roll. When 2,000 feet of runway separation exists at the beginning of takeoff roll, use a 5-second delay instead of 10 seconds.<br><br>. 9.1.2 Aborted Takeoff. In the event of an aborted takeoff, the aircraft aborting must immediately.<br><br>notify the other aircraft. The aircraft not aborting should add max power and accelerate ahead and out of the way of the aborting aircraft. This allows the aborting aircraft to steer to the center of the runway and engage the arresting gear, if required.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-1.<br><br>

            . 9.1.3 Parade. The parade position is established by aligning the bottom wingtip light (located aboutin the middle of the missile rail) with the light on the LEX. Superimposing the two establishes a bearing line and step down. Proper wingtip clearance is set by reference to the exhaust nozzles. When the left and right nozzles are aligned so that there is no detectable curve to the nozzles, the reference line is correct. The intersection of the reference line with the bearing line is the proper parade position.<br><br>See figure 9-2.<br><br>Parade turns are either standard (VFR) or instrument turns. During day VFR conditions, turns away from the wingman are standard turns. To execute, when lead turns away, the wingmen roll the aircraft about its own axis and increase power slightly to maintain rate of turn with the leader. Lateral separation is maintained by increasing g. Proper step down is maintained by keeping the leads fuselage on the horizon.<br>Turns into the wingmen and all IFR or night turns in a parade formation are instrument turns.<br>During instrument turns maintain a parade position relative to the lead throughout the turn.<br>After initially joining up in echelon, three and four-plane formations normally use balanced parade formation. In balanced parade, number 3 steps out until the exhaust nozzles on number 2 are flush.<br>This leaves enough space between number 3 and lead for number 2 to cross under into echelon.<br>When it is necessary to enter IFR conditions with a three or four-plane formation, the lead directs the flight to assume fingertip formation. In this formation number 3 moves up into close parade on the lead. All turns are instrument turns.<br><br>. 9.1.4 Cruise Formation. The cruise position is a looser formation which allows the wingmen more.<br><br>time for visual lookout. Cruise provides the wingmen with a cone of maneuver behind the leader which allows the wingman to make turns by pulling inside the leader and requires little throttle change.<br>The cruise position is defined by a line from the lead pilot’s head, through the trailing edge of the wingtip missile rail, with 10 feet of nose to tail separation. The wingmen are free to maneuver within the 70° cone established by that bearing line on either wing. In a division formation, number 3 should fly the bearing line, but always leave adequate room for number 2 and lead. Number 4 flies cruise about number 3.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-3.<br><br>

            . 9.1.5 Section Approaches/Landing. The aircraft is comfortable to fly in formation, even at the low.<br><br>airspeeds associated with an approach and landing. The rapid power response enhances position keeping ability. The formation strip lighting provides a ready visual reference at night and the dual radios generally ensure that intra-flight comm is available.<br>During section approaches all turns are instrument turns about the leader. When a penetration is commenced the leader retards power to 75% rpm and descends at 250 knots. If a greater descent rate is required the speedbrake may be used. Approximately 5 miles from the final approach fix or GCA pickup the lead gives the signal for landing gear.<br><br>. 9.1.5.1 Section Landing.

            The wingman touches down first and decelerates on his half of the runway as an individual. Do not attempt to brake in section.

            . 9.2.2.1 Approach.<br><br>Be careful to avoid damaging the right AOA probe by contact with basket or hose. If the probe is damaged, it will cause a 4 channel AOA failure.<br>Once cleared to commence an approach, refueling checklists completed, assume a position 10 to 15 feet in trail of the drogue with the refueling probe in line in both the horizontal and vertical reference planes. Trim the aircraft in this stabilized approach position and ensure that the tanker’s (amber) ready light is on before attempting an approach. Select a reference point on the tanker as a primary alignment guide during the approach phase; secondarily, rely on peripheral vision of the drogue and hose. Increase power to establish minimum closure rate on the drogue not to exceed 5 knots. An excessive closure rate causes a violent hose whip following contact and/or increase the danger of structural damage to the aircraft in the event of misalignment; whereas, too slow a closure rate results in the pilot fencing with the drogue as it oscillates in close proximity to the aircraft nose. During the final phase of the approach, the drogue has a tendency to move slightly upward and to the right as it passes the nose of the receiver aircraft due to the aircraft-drogue airstream interaction. Small corrections in the approach phase are acceptable; however, if alignment is off in the final phase, it is best to immediately retire to the initial approach position and commence another approach, compensating for previous misalignment by adjusting the reference point selected on the tanker. Make small lateral corrections with the rudder, and vertical corrections with the stabilator. Avoid any corrections about the longitudinal axis since they cause probe displacement in both the lateral and vertical reference planes.<br><br>. 9.2.2.2 Missed Approach. If the receiver probe passes forward of the drogue basket without making.<br><br>contact, initiate a missed approach immediately. If the probe impinges on the rim of the basket and tips it, initiate a missed approach. A missed approach is executed by reducing power and backing to the rear at a 3 to 5 knot opening rate. By continuing an approach past the basket, a pilot might hook the probe over the hose and/or permit the drogue to contact the receiver aircraft fuselage. Either of these hazards require more skill to calmly unravel the hose and drogue without causing further damage than to make another approach. If the initial approach position is well in line with the drogue, the chance of hooking the hose is diminished when last minute corrections are kept to a minimum. After executing a missed approach, analyze previous misalignment problems and apply positive corrections to avoid a hazardous tendency to blindly stab at the drogue.<br>. 9.2.2.3 Contact. When the receiver probe engages the basket, it seats itself into the drogue couplingand a slight ripple is evident in the refueling hose. The drogue and hose must be pushed forward 3 to 5 feet by the receiver probe before fuel transfer can be effected. This position is evident by the tanker’s (amber) ready light going out and the (green) fuel transfer light coming on. While plugged-in, fly a close tail chase formation on the tanker. Although this tucked-in condition restricts the tanker’s maneu- verability, gradual changes involving heading, altitude and/or airspeed may be made. A sharp lookout doctrine must be maintained due to the precise flying imposed on both the tanker and receiver pilots.<br>In this respect, the tanker can be assisted by other aircraft in the formation.<br><br>. 9.2.2.4 Disengagement. Disengagement from a successful contact is accomplished by reducing.<br><br>power and backing out at a 3 to 5 knot separation rate. Maintain the same relative alignment on the tanker as upon engagement. The receiver probe separates from the drogue coupling when the hose reaches full extension. When clear of the drogue, place the refueling probe switch in the RETRACT <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-7.<br><br>

The aerial banner tow target equipment consists of a tow.<br><br>adapter, a standard TDU-32/B 8.5 X 40 foot aerial banner target and approximately 1,500 feet of 11/64-inch armored cable towline, fitted at both ends with a MK-8 tow ring for military takeoffs.<br>Afterburner operations require a 75-foot leader of 3/8 inch diameter steel cable attached to the tow cable.<br>The tow adapter is installed on the hinge point assembly of the tail hook by ground crew personnel.<br>Pilot action is not required for banner hookup. The banner is released in flight or on deck by lowering the tail hook.<br><br>. 9.3.2 Ground Procedures. The following procedures are provided for guidance. Local course rules.<br><br>may dictate modifications of these steps.<br>. 1. When tower clearance onto the duty runway is received, the tow aircraft taxis to a position asdirected by the tow hookup crew. The tow pilot holds the position until released by the tow hookup crew. The escort pilot maintains position on the taxiway at the approach end of the runway.<br>. 2. When signaled to do so by the tow hookup crew, the tow pilot proceeds to taxi down the runway.. 3. Upon receipt of a visual taxi signal from the tow hookup crew to “slow down”, the escort pilotrelays this signal to the tow pilot via UHF radio.<br>. 4. Upon receipt of a visual taxi signal from the tow hookup crew to “stop”, the escort pilot relays thissignal to the tow pilot via his UHF radio.<br>. 5. Upon receipt of a signal from the tow hookup crew that the “tow hookup is complete”, the escortpilot requests the tow pilot to “take up slack”.<br>. 6. The tow pilot proceeds to taxi down the runway.. 7. When the banner moves forward onto the runway, the escort pilot transmits “tow aircrafthold-good banner” and taxis onto the runway abeam the banner for takeoff.<br>. 8. When ready, the tow pilot transmits “Tower, Lizard 616 for banner takeoff, escort follow on agood banner”.<br>. 9. After the banner becomes airborne, the escort pilot commences takeoff roll.<br>. 9.3.3 Flight Procedures.

            . 9.3.3.1 Takeoff. Normal MIL power takeoff procedures, including rotation speeds and techniques,.<br><br>are suitable when towing the banner, and are recommended except when operating in high ambient temperatures or at high density altitude airfields. When the steel cable leader is added to the tow cable, takeoff can be made at MAX power.<br>. • Takeoff ground roll with banner can be estimated by adding a factor of10% to basic aircraft takeoff performance. If aircraft lift-off does not occur prior to crossing the long field arresting gear, the gear must be removed to preclude the banner being torn off.<br>. • When using afterburner, the aircraft nose should be held on deck until10 knots past flying speed to minimize cable time in the afterburner plume. If the crosswind component exceeds 10 knots, the takeoff roll should be made on the upwind side of the runway centerline to prevent the banner from drifting close to the runway edge lights on the downwind side of the runway.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>If takeoff is aborted, basic emergency procedures are applicable. The tow cable releases when the tailhook is lowered.<br>After lift-off, the initial climb attitude to 1,200 feet AGL varies with existing weather conditions.<br>However, an initial pitch attitude of 15 to 20° is a good starting point. Afterburner operation requires a 5 to 10° higher pitch attitude. Do not exceed 25° of pitch attitude. Select landing gear UP and flaps AUTO when definitely airborne. Climb out at 200 to 220 knots.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Tow airspeeds in excess of 220 knots result in excessive banner fraying.<br><br>. 9.3.3.2 Cruise/Pattern. No special pilot techniques are required when towing a banner. Enroute.<br><br>cruising speed of 180 to 220 knots provides adequate energy for mild maneuvering while minimizing banner fray. ATC is effective for airspeed control. The tow aircraft must call all turns to allow the chase to position on the outside of the turn.<br>Without the banner, any remaining cable flails unpredictably and could damage the aircraft. The chase should approach the tow aircraft from abeam to verify cable failure, avoiding a cone-shaped area defined by the tow’s 4 to 8 o’clock positions. The tow aircraft should then lower the tail hook as soon as practical.<br><br>. 9.3.3.3 Descent. Descend at 160 to 220 knots. Use speedbrake as desired to increase the rate of.<br><br>descent.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-9.<br><br>

            . 9.3.3.4 Banner Drop. Banner drop speed should be accomplished at a comfortable airspeed below.<br><br>200 knots. Drop the banner in wings level flight at a minimum of 500 feet AGL. The chase should ensure adequate clearance exists between the banner and ground obstacles during approach to the drop zone and provide calls to assist in line-up. Release is normally called by the tower when the banner is over the center of the drop zone. Release is accomplished by lowering the tailhook. Because of the low release altitude, crosswind has no appreciable effect on the banner impact point (i.e., the banner hits down range of the release point). Following banner release, raise the tailhook.<br>. 9.3.3.5 Banner Release Failure. If the arresting hook fails to extend, the banner cannot be released.<br>In this case, the following procedure is recommended:<br><br>. 1. Select full afterburner while increasing AOA in an attempt to burn through the cable.<br>If cable remains -.<br><br>. 2. In the gunnery range (or other cleared area), descend to lower altitude and slow to a comfortableairspeed below 200 knots maximum and 100 to 200 feet AGL. This drags the banner off on the ground (or water). Have the escort pilot confirm that the banner breaks off on ground collision and determine the length of the remaining tow cable.<br>The escort pilot must remain well clear of the remaining cable. The last 25% of the remaining cable flails unpredictably.<br>. 3. If 100 feet or greater remaining tow cable length is confirmed by the escort pilot, plan totouchdown 1,000 to 1,500 feet long, runway length permitting.<br>Every effort must be made by the tow pilot not to drag the remaining tow cable across lines, fences, etc., due to property damage that will result.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>The long touchdown should be carefully planned because arrestment is impossible.<br><br>. 9.3.4 Target Chase Procedures.<br><br><br>. 9.3.4.1 Primary Chase Responsibilities.<br><br>. 1.

The chase remains on the outside of all turns to ensure clearance from the banner and preventloss of airspeed during turns.<br>. 3. If IMC is encountered, the chase should move forward and fly wing on tow until VMC.<br>. 9.4 NIGHT VISION DEVICE (NVD) OPERATIONS.<br><br><br>. 9.4.1 Effects on Vision. Flight techniques and visual cues used during unaided night flying also.<br><br>apply to flying with NVDs. The advantage of NVD is improved ground reference provided through image intensifier systems (NVG/NAVFLIR). Dark adaptation is unnecessary for the effective viewing through night vision goggles (NVG). In fact, viewing through the NVG for a short period of time shortens the normal dark adaptation period. After using NVG, it takes the average individual 1 to 3 minutes to reach the 30 minute dark adaptation level. Color discrimination is absent when viewing the NVG image. The image is seen in a monochromatic green hue and is less distinct than normal vision.<br>Prolonged usage may result in visual illusions upon removal of the NVG. These illusions include complement or green after-images when viewing contrasting objects. Illusions from NVG are temporary and normal physiological phenomena and the length of time the effects last vary with the individual.<br>. • Ejection wearing night vision goggles is not recommended. Severe neckinjury may result.<br>. • Aircrew are strongly cautioned against maneuvering above 3 g withthe AN/AVS-9 in the up-locked (not in use but on helmet) position because the NVD bracket cannot retain AN/AVS-9 under elevated g loads.<br><br>. 9.4.2 Effects of Light. Any non-NVG compatible light source in the cockpit degrades the ability to.<br><br>see with NVG. In aircraft 163985 AND UP, filters are used to prevent stray or scattered light from reaching the NVG intensifiers, which would cause the automatic gain control to reduce the NVG image intensification. Head down displays (DDI, MPCD) are filtered to allow non-electrical-optical viewing of the display. Viewing areas illuminated by artificial light sources with NVG (runway/landing lights, flares, or aircraft position lights) limit the ability to see objects outside of the area.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Bright ground lights may cause loss of ground references during landing. Avoid looking directly at bright light sources to prevent degrading NVG vision.<br>The NAVFLIR however, is not affected by light sources and therefore complements NVG use.<br><br>. 9.4.3 Weather Conditions. NAVFLIR and NVG provide a limited capability to see through visibility.<br><br>restrictions such as fog, rain, haze, and certain types of smoke. As the density of the visibility <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-11.<br><br>

Use of an offset scanning technique helps to alert the pilot to severe weather conditions.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Visibility restrictions produce a ‘‘halo’’ effect around artificial lights.<br><br>. 9.4.4 Object/Target Detection. Detection ranges are largely a function of the existing atmosphere.<br><br>and environmental conditions. Moving targets with contrasting backgrounds or targets with a reflected or generated light or heat sources can be identified at greater ranges when using NVD.<br><br>. 9.4.5 Flight Preparation.

To execute a waveoff, immediately add full power and maintain optimum attitude.<br><br>Make all waveoffs straight ahead until clear of the landing area.<br><br>. 9.5.4 Arrested Landing. The aircraft should be on runway centerline at touchdown. Aircraft.<br><br>alignment should be straight down the runway with no drift. Upon touchdown, maintain the throttle at the approach position. When arrestment is assured, retard the throttle to idle. Allow the aircraft to roll back to permit the hook to disengage from the pendant. When directed by the taxi director, apply both brakes to stop the rollback and raise the hook. If further rollback is directed, release brakes and allow the aircraft to be pulled back until a brake signal is given. Then apply brakes judiciously to prevent the aircraft from tipping or rocking back.<br>Use extreme caution when taxiing on a wet SATS runway.<br><br>. 9.5.5 Bolter. Bolters are easily accomplished. Simultaneously apply full power and retract the.<br><br>arresting gear hook. Smoothly rotate the aircraft to a lift-off attitude and fly away.<br>Bolters in GAIN ORIDE require more aft stick input for rotation due to fixed AOA feedback and zero rudder toe−in deflections. Half-aft stick is recommended for rotation from bolters in GAIN ORIDE to reduce aircraft settle.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-9-12.<br><br>

The checks are presented in consecutive order simulating a recommended checkflight profile. The profile itself may be altered as required, however, the sequential steps listed for a system/component evaluation are mandatory. Because of restricted operating areas, pilot technique or other limiting factors, a full checkflight profile may require more than one flight.<br>Therefore, it is permissible to divide the recommended checkflight profile, as required, to compensate for these conditions. If a checkflight is divided, it is permissible for another pilot to complete the checklist, provided there is a thorough passdown, either verbal or written, between the pilots.<br>Requirements for functional checkflights are listed in COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 Series with the following exceptions specific to the F/A-18. An FCF is not required for the installation or reinstallation of a known good engine provided satisfactory ground checks have been completed, unless both engines are being installed or reinstalled. A ‘‘known good engine’’ is defined as an engine removed and reinstalled in the same aircraft to facilitate other maintenance, or an engine in operational use cannibalized from another aircraft. An FCF is not required for the reinstallation of a known good movable flight control surface provided satisfactory completion of BIT checks on deck. A ‘‘ known good movable flight control surface’’ is defined as a flap, aileron, horizontal stab, or rudder surface only (not servocylinder). FCF checks are required under the following circumstances:<br>PRO A - Full Aircraft check . - Acceptance. - Down time in excess of 30 days. - If no FCF As within past year (12 months). - Anytime requested by the Commanding Officer<br>PRO B - Engines.<br><br>. - Dual engine removal (reinstallation/replacement). - Dual ECA change. - Dual main fuel control change. - Installation of any unknown engine. - Anytime requested by the Commanding OfficerPRO C - Flight Controls . - Anytime a flight control surface is re-rigged. - Installation of any flight control servo-cylinder or hydraulic drive unit. - Anytime requested by the Commanding Officer<br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIII-10-1.<br><br>

            CHAPTER 11.<br><br><br>Flight Characteristics.<br><br><br>. 11.1 HANDLING QUALITIES.<br><br>The flight control system (FCS) is designed to provide both stability and controllability. Stability, the measure of the aircraft’s resistance to external disturbing forces, provides a predictable and steady platform for accomplishing various weapons delivery tasks. Controllability, the measure of ease of changing the aircraft’s speed, direction and acceleration provides the means for flying the aircraft aggressively. The flight control system achieves both stability and controllability by monitoring aircraft motion and pilot input, applying preprogrammed control laws, and then commanding control surface movement to provide the responsiveness and maneuverability of an agile fighter and the steady platform of a good attack aircraft.<br><br>. 11.1.1 Flight Control Modes. Handling qualities are dependent on the mode in which the FCS is.<br><br>operating. The mode is determined by the FLAP switch position (AUTO or HALF/FULL). However, if airspeed exceeds approximately 240 KCAS the flight controls automatically switch to the AUTO mode regardless of the FLAP switch position. The FCS control laws are designed to minimize transients when transitioning between modes.<br><br>. 11.1.2 HALF or FULL Flap Configuration. The FCS incorporates full-time AOA feedback in the.<br><br>flaps HALF or FULL mode. For this reason, longitudinal trim is required when changing AOA and/or airspeed. When the aircraft is trimmed to an AOA, it tends to maintain that AOA and some longitudinal stick force or trim is required to fly at another AOA. The aircraft is very responsive in pitch. Precise aircraft response is generally best achieved using small control inputs. Rapid longitu- dinal control inputs can saturate the stabilator actuator resulting in a PIO. PIOs have occurred during both field and carrier approaches, especially when using ATC. During the final portion of approaches using ATC, try to make small pitch control inputs. Although lateral response is characterized by slight adverse yaw, heading control is good.<br><br>. 11.1.2.1 Stalls in HALF or FULL Flaps. With flaps HALF one g stalls exhibit somewhat better lateral.<br><br>directional flying qualities than with flaps FULL. Wing rock and sideslip excursions occur in the 20° AOA region. Warning cues occur at 12° (increasing stick force gradient) and 15° (departure warning tone). With flaps FULL, as AOA increases to 12°, buffet and the departure warning tone provide good stall warning cues of impending high AOA. At 12° AOA, an increase in the stick force/AOA gradient can also be felt. This provides additional stall warning. Onset of wing rock occurs in the 15° AOA region. As AOA is further increased, aft stick requirements increase. Wing rock increases in amplitude and is accompanied by sideslip oscillations as the aft stick stop is reached. For either flap setting, maximum attainable AOA is about 25°. Large rates of descent may occur above the AOA limit in HALF or FULL flaps. Immediate stall recovery is obtained by neutralizing longitudinal stick which rapidly reduces AOA and allows the aircraft to attain the current trim value.<br><br>. 11.1.2.2 Takeoff and Landing Characteristics. During takeoff, stick aft of neutral should be.<br><br>commanded at the computed Nose Wheel Lift Off (NWLO) speed (see Chapter 7). Commanding aft stick too early can result in longer takeoff rolls due to the added drag of the stabilators. While the aircraft has WOW, the flight control logic has been optimized for catapult takeoff and is designed to anticipate flight by programming in some functions during the takeoff roll.

            the pilot to overcontrol directional and lateral inputs if proper landing technique is not used. This is particularly true during wet runway or crosswind landing. Gross misapplication of the control stick or rudder pedals can cause lateral and directional control problems regardless of runway condition. Two separate WOW functions control the FCS logic after touchdown. The first occurs when the aircraft weight is on any two landing gear. When this occurs, the FCS no longer attempts to maintain trim AOA. Stabilator position is a function of stick position and trim setting. The speedbrake can also be extended and remain extended without having to hold the speedbrake switch aft. Additionally, the rudder pedal to roll CAS interconnect is faded to zero. The second function occurs after aircraft weight is on two wheels and airspeed is below 100 knots. At this time, the rolling surface to rudder interconnect (RSRI) is faded to zero. Thus, during normal landing rollout, the RSRI is active until 100 knots. As a result, above 100 knots a lateral stick input also commands the rudder in the same direction in anticipation of adverse yaw that would normally occur in flight. Use of lateral stick should be minimized during the landing roll.<br><br>. 11.1.2.3 Takeoff, Landing, and Catapult Launch with High Lateral Weight Asymmetries.<br><br>Acceleration during field takeoff will result in yaw in the direction of the asymmetry that is easily controlled with appropriate NWS inputs. After field takeoff, expect a controllable roll into the heavy wing. Setting the appropriate lateral trim minimizes roll rate after catapult launch. During dual engine operation and at normal takeoff and landing angles of attack, sufficient lateral directional control power is available with flaps HALF or FULL and lateral weight asymmetries up to 26,000 ft−lbs. At asymmetries below 20,000 ft−lbs, lateral directional control does not degrade until about 18° AOA, where the lateral directional control power becomes insufficient to counter yaw/roll rates. At asymmetries above 20,000 ft−lbs, lateral directional control power does not degrade until about 15° AOA, where the directional control power becomes insufficient to counter yaw rates. During single engine operation, lateral weight asymmetry significantly increases minimum control airspeed. At high asymmetries, exceeding 12° AOA with flaps HALF and 10° AOA with flaps FULL may generate yaw rates that cannot be arrested with rudder unless AOA is reduced. Additionally, large lateral stick inputs (over ½ stick deflection) during single engine, high asymmetry operation can result in adverse yaw and compound directional controllability. As a result, countering yaw/roll in the landing or catapult launch configuration requires aggressive rudder inputs combined with proper AOA control, timely stores jettison, and judicious use of lateral stick (less than ½ stick deflection).<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>When raising the flaps from HALF to AUTO while accelerating during missed approach with high lateral asymmetry, large sideslip excursions will be experienced. These excursions result in full scale deflections of the slip indicator (SI) ball and damp out after a few seconds. Avoid chasing the ball with rudders as that will tend to aggravate the condition. Maintain previous rudder input until oscillations have damped out, then use rudders as necessary to maintain balanced flight.<br>When landing in a crosswind, land with the heavy wing upwind if possible. Landing with the heavy wing upwind increases lateral control power and improves lateral directional handling characteristics.<br>On touchdown, the light wing will rise 3 to 5°, depending on the lateral asymmetry. The greater the asymmetry, the greater the wing rise. This wing rise is comparable to landing in a 15 knot crosswind, and can be countered by judicious lateral stick input. The aircraft is easily controlled. Aggressive <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-2.<br><br>

The FCS control laws create slightly different handling qualities.<br><br>than those of most aircraft. The most apparent characteristic is the excellent hands-off stability.<br>Damping about all axes is high. Static longitudinal stability is neutral since the FCS attempts to keep the aircraft in 1 g, zero pitch rate flight. Longitudinal trim is used to bias (adjust) the reference load factor or pitch rate as the pilot desires. Longitudinal trimming is not required as the aircraft accelerates or decelerates through most of the flight envelope. Once an attitude is set, the aircraft tends to hold that attitude without further stick inputs, even through the transonic speed regime. This characteristic reduces stick forces with changing airspeed, lowering pilot workload for most tasks. However, some flight tasks are made more difficult because the FCS attempts to maintain 1 g flight. For example, during a dive or steep zoom climb, a small but constant forward stick force is required to maintain a constant attitude. Airspeed changes cannot be sensed through changing stick forces and difficulty may be encountered when trying to maintain a desired airspeed during high workload tasks such as instrument penetration/approach. The FCS incorporates AOA feedback above 22° AOA. To increase AOA above the feedback AOA of 22°, aft stick must be applied. The AOA for the highest lift available (CLmax) is approximately 35° AOA. The maximum steady state AOA with full aft stick (35 pounds stick force) is 50 to 55°. AOA control is good up through max AOA. If the aft stick is released, the FCS commands nose down pitch until the AOA is reduced below the feedback AOA of 22°. At this time, the AOA feedback is removed and the FCS again seeks to maintain 1 g flight.<br>A constant departure warning tone is activated above 35° and below −7° AOA. With inboard tanks and stores on outboard stations the tone is activated at 25° AOA. The warning tone provides information that: (1) the pilot may have placed the aircraft in a departure prone region of the flight envelope; or (2) the aircraft is near the AOA for maximum lift (CLmax). However, the departure warning tone logic has not been updated to reflect the expanded AOA envelope provided by FCC <br>PROM 10.7.<br><br>. 11.1.4 Pitch Stability. The FCS provides artificial pitch stability in CAS that prevents significanthandling qualities variation with CG movement due to fuel transfer or stores release/delivery.<br>Longitudinal control effectiveness and pitch damping are satisfactory up to the AOA/CG limits listed in Chapter 4. These limits are based on aircraft pitch stability margins and prevent the aircraft from entering an AOA hang−up condition. During flight in a degraded FCS mode (MECH or pitch DEL) aircraft stability is be seriously degraded aft of the CG limit and controllability is significantly reduced.<br>. 11.1.5 Stick Force. In maneuvering flight, there is a light but constant stick force per g (about 3.5 to. 4.5 pounds/g). Unlike many other aircraft, maneuvering stick forces do not vary significantly over theentire operating envelope as long as the AOA is less than AOA feedback of 22°. Where AOA feedback is active, maneuvering stick forces are increased significantly.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-3.<br><br>

            Rapid aft stick movement, with or without g limit override, commands a very high g onset rate. This high g onset rate can cause immediate loss of consciousness without the usual symptoms of tunnel vision, greyout, and blackout. Consciousness may not return for more than 20 seconds after the g level is reduced to near 1 g.<br><br>. 11.1.6 Pitch Up. A pitch bobble occurs during speedbrake extension/retraction especially during.<br><br>high speed flight. There is a slight tendency to over control pitch during speedbrake operation in tight formation at high speed (over 400 knots). The aircraft exhibits a moderate transonic pitch up when decelerating rapidly through the Mach 1.0 to 0.95 while maintaining a high load factor. This pitch up seldom is more than a 1½ g increment in load factor. This transonic pitch up is not noticeable during 1 g deceleration or slow deceleration at high load factors.<br><br>. 11.1.7 G−Limiter. The g−limiter function in the FCS limits commanded load factor under most.<br><br>flight conditions to the symmetric load limit (NzREF) based on gross weight below 44,000 pounds gross weight (maximum NzREF limit of 7.5 g). Above 44,000 pounds, NzREF is held constant at 5.5 g. The negative load factor limit command is fixed at negative 3 g’s for all gross weights. At weights greater than 32,357 pounds the g−limiter does not provide adequate negative g protection and aircraft overstress is possible.<br>During rolling maneuvers, the g−limiter reduces commanded load factor up to 80% NzREF. The additional reduction begins with 0.75 inch lateral stick up to 80% at full lateral stick input of 3 inches.<br>Very abrupt stick commands can exceed the capabilities of the system and result in an overstress. The g−limiter can be disengaged during emergency situations by pressing the paddle switch to allow 33% more load factor capability, but overstress is much more likely in this condition. During decelerations through transonic flight conditions (0.88M - 1.04M) NzREF is decremented to account for dynamic pitch−up transients. This FCS function, called the G−bucket, automatically unloads the aircraft to prevent exceeding the design load limit.<br><br>. 11.1.8 Aircraft Stability and Dynamic Response. The aircraft roll rate is good throughout the.<br><br>flight envelope. The roll response is essentially constant through 15° AOA. Rolls conducted at 15 to 20° AOA are prone to slight residual left/right motion upon termination. Above 20° AOA, sideslip and sideslip rate feedbacks become active to damp out sideslip oscillations and minimize left/right residual motion. From 25 to 35° AOA, roll performance gradually decreases with increasing AOA. Above 25° AOA, pedal and lateral stick inputs provide similar responses. Above 35° AOA and at low airspeed the roll performance is essentially constant. If the AOA is over 35°, the yaw rate warning tone is replaced by the departure warning tone and yaw rate warning is not available. From 35 to 55° AOA, combined lateral stick and pedal inputs produce enhanced roll performance compared to individual control inputs. AOA excursions into the 60s are possible with this input, which can have the consequence of blanking the air data system and indicating 48 KCAS in the HUD. Above 40° AOA small sideforce oscillations may occur. Full aft stick results in maximum sustained AOAs between 50 and 55°. At these AOAs, high rates of descent (18,000 fpm) occur and the aircraft exhibits small, stable pitch oscillations.<br>Above 50° AOA, undesirable yaw rates can develop, particularly with imperfections on the radome.<br>Rates can be noticeably higher than minor yaw rate tendencies. Loud airframe and vortex rumbling noises are heard in the cockpit in the 50 to 55° AOA region. If a yaw rate develops in the 50 to 55° AOA region, easing the control stick forward off the aft stop should immediately reduce the AOA below 50° and terminate the yawing motion.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-4.<br><br>

            If AOA is not immediately reduced, sustained yaw rate in the 50 to 55° AOA region can lead to the display of spin recovery command arrows and inadvertent departure from controlled flight.<br>At Mach numbers greater than 0.8 at AOA greater than 20°, roll control power available to the pilot is automatically reduced by the FCS in order to prevent nose slice departures.<br>Rolling at less than 1 g can cause large roll coupling tendencies and can lead to a departure. The further the g level decreases below 1 g, the larger the coupling tendencies become and the tendency toward departure increases. If the pilot feels the roll is starting to diverge, through lateral looseness or rapid uncommanded pitch excursion, he should immediately neutralize controls and terminate the roll.<br>The flight characteristics described above combine to provide a very agile fighter throughout the envelope. Excellent pitch pointing capabilities beyond 35° AOA and precise lift vector placement allow rapid acquisition and fine tracking of air−to−air targets. Above 25° AOA, rudder pedal and lateral stick inputs command very similar deflection of control surfaces and thus, similar aircraft performance for bank angle and lift vector control. For symmetrically loaded aircraft, the excellent departure resistance provides the capability to aggressively reposition the aircraft lift vector with stick and rudder inputs, even while maintaining high AOA.<br><br>. 11.1.8.1 High AOA Flying Qualities. Use caution during low−speed overhead maneuvers as the.<br><br>aircraft tends to enter a tailslide if airspeed is insufficient to complete the maneuver. Aft stick must be increased near the top of a slow speed loop. If the controls are released or aft stick is not increased, AOA feedback commands enough nose down stabilator (full nose down if necessary) to reduce the AOA below feedback AOA (22°) that can result in a relatively steady, nose−high attitude. Apply sufficient aft stick while enough airspeed is still available to establish and maintain a positive pitch rate to keep the aircraft nose tracking through the horizon. Use maximum allowable AOA based on stores loading and center of gravity. Maintain aft stick until the nose is below the horizon and airspeed is increasing.<br>Neutralizing or releasing the controls near the top of a low−speed overhead maneuver is not a good practice because the nose does not tend to fall through due to the AOA feedback driving full nose down stabilator, resulting in a nose high, inverted condition as described above. PROM 10.7 increases departure resistance and improves recoverability from out−of−control flight, but it does not prevent departures due to insufficient airspeed. If the aircraft ceases to respond to control inputs, an out of control situation exists.<br>Starting overhead maneuvers with insufficient airspeed may lead to nose high, ballistic conditions and departure. The aircraft responds to control inputs at low airspeed with few cues to impending loss of control.<br>Recovery from post departure gyrations and developed out of control motion can require considerable altitude. Entry into such a departure at low altitudes will likely preclude recovery prior to ground impact.<br>The excellent controllability and maneuverability at high AOA provided by the FCS control laws result in superior nose pointing and gun tracking at low airspeeds.

            AOA, sideslip and sideslip rate feedback (beta and betadot feedback) provide rapid aircraft maneu- verability with aggressive control inputs without sacrificing departure resistance. Enhanced departure resistance allows the pilot to safely command yaw rates up to the yaw rate tone (40°/sec). Above 25° AOA, lateral stick or rudder command the same, well controlled, aircraft rolling response. If opposite stick and pedal are commanded the inputs will essentially cancel each other out and little to no roll response will result.<br>The FCS incorporates pirouette logic to produce abrupt heading reversals at high AOA (>25°) and low airspeed (<210 KCAS). Pirouette logic can be engaged above 25° AOA and below 210 KCAS by applying full lateral stick and pedal in the same direction. When the criteria are met, the FCS recognizes the pilot’s desire to rapidly reverse aircraft heading and displaces control surfaces appropriately, resulting in a well controlled maneuver. Spin display logic is modified during a commanded pirouette to prevent nuisance spin indications. Aircraft motion can be stopped at the desired heading by applying full lateral stick and pedal in the direction opposite that which initiated the maneuver.<br><br>. 11.1.8.2 High Speed Asymmetric FLIR Pod Handling Qualities (TFLIR, ATFLIR, NAVFLIR). Flight.<br><br>of a clean aircraft with a single TFLIR/ATFLIR pod (with or without pylons) will result in a roll−off in the direction of the pod of up to 12°/second at transonic (0.90−1.05 IMN) Mach numbers. Above . 1.05 IMN, the roll−off begins to decrease, and eventually reverses direction above 1.15 IMN. Althoughnot individually flight tested, the NAVFLIR is considered to be aerodynamically equivalent to the TFLIR/ATFLIR and is expected to produce similar roll−off characteristics. Above 0.90 IMN, slight variations in Mach require large variations in both lateral and directional trim settings to reduce roll−off and large side forces and maintain ′′hands off’’ balanced flight. The magnitude of the roll−off at peak conditions (0.95 IMN) can be trimmed out. Additionally, lateral inputs are required under elevated load factor to maintain the same roll attitude. This additional pilot workload should be considered during low altitude flight where mission crosscheck time is critical.<br>Although an asymmetric FLIR pod produces only 1,500 ft−lb of lateral weight asymmetry, it can result in a significant amount of lateral aerodynamic asymmetry during flight above 0.90 IMN. The roll−off phenomenon is dominated by this aerodynamic asymmetry, not the lateral weight asymmetry.<br>During flight simulation, level bomb deliveries using the FLIR for target identification and refinement were flown in a night environment with no outside visual reference. Uncommanded roll−off appeared as a rotating FLIR image similar to what is displayed during over−flight of the designated target. It is possible that uncommanded aircraft bank changes, seen as a rotating FLIR image through the sensor, may be confused with the rotating image that results from target over−flight.<br>Uncommanded roll−off due to single FLIR pod carriage during heads- down sensor operation may result in an unusual aircraft attitude, disorientation, altitude loss, and possible CFIT.<br><br>. 11.1.9 Flying Qualities with Lateral Weight Asymmetries. The aircraft demonstrates good flying.<br><br>qualities with lateral weight asymmetries up to 26,000 ft-lb. With low lateral weight asymmetries (less than 8,000 ft-lb), flying qualities are excellent. The heavy wing tends to drop under positive g, and rise during negative g. The greater the load factor, the greater the lateral stick deflection required to maintain wings level. As load factor is increased, lateral stick opposite the heavy wing is required to maintain wings level up to approximately 25° AOA, above which lateral stick into the heavy wing is required to maintain wings level or minimize roll rate.

            although, special attention to AOA and sideslip control is recommended. During aggressive aft stick maneuvers with lateral asymmetries between 6000 and 8000 ft-lbs (no positive AOA limit for air−to−air loadings), sideslip into the heavy wing builds notably as the aircraft rolls towards the heavy wing. The tendency to roll into the heavy wing can be countered with either combined full lateral stick and rudder pedal inputs or by relaxing the aft stick input to reduce AOA. Full lateral stick inputs followed by full aft stick inputs without first centering the lateral stick (as in guns defense maneuvering) will result in rapid sideslip buildup and a nose-slice departure. Recovery from this departure occurs quickly by neutralizing controls.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Sideslip buildup into the heavy wing is typical as AOA exceeds 25° with asymmetries near 6,000 ft−lbs, and may result in a nose slice departure.

The FCS incorporates a number of features that augment the aircraft’s.<br><br>natural departure and spin resistance. In CAS mode, very aggressive maneuvering is possible. The F/A−18 is very stable and controllable throughout most of the operational flight envelope. However it is departure prone in some flight regimes which pilots must be aware of to avoid inadvertent departures. Factors that directly affect entry and recovery from OCF are external store loading, aft CG, lateral asymmetry, and flight control degradations. Misapplied controls and/or overaggressive maneu- vering in departure prone regions of the flight envelope cause nose-slice departures. Application of excessive coordinated inputs, cross control inputs or aggressive forward stick significantly increases risk of departure. As Mach increases, this risk further increases. Asymmetric thrust, including Max/Idle or Max/Flameout splits does not, by itself, cause a departure. However, large thrust asymmetry combined with aggravated pilot control inputs may cause a nose−slice departure under otherwise benign conditions. Lower altitudes aggravate asymmetric thrust effects due to the larger thrust differential.<br>Yaw stability augmentation significantly reduces the likelihood of departure throughout the envelope.

Typical F/A−18 departures occur as a yaw divergence.<br><br>(nose−slice) followed by an uncommanded roll in the same direction. The yaw rate warning tone may not provide sufficient departure warning. Vortex rumble which occurs when sideslip is excessive or during abrupt lateral acceleration is a good departure warning cue. However, vortex rumble may not be noticed during aggressive maneuvering. Side force build−up is also a good indicator of an impending departure. The initial phase of the departure is not particularly violent or disorienting unless it occurs at high airspeed/Mach, where large cross control inputs cause rapid unloading, abrupt nose down pitch rate and violent departure.<br>At AOAs below 5° and Mach 0.8 or greater, 3/4 to full cross control application results in violent departure and possible airframe damage.<br>The aircraft is significantly more departure prone with large lateral asymmetry. Departures at high airspeed with large lateral asymmetry are violent and yaw and roll away from the heavy wing.<br>NATOPS AOA limitations must be honored to avoid departure. Excessive sideslip, which builds with AOA, increases departure susceptibility. Keep the slip indicator (SI) ball centered to minimize sideslip and consider coordinating rudder pedal input to during roll maneuvers into the heavy wing. Maximum AOA limits are significantly reduced as lateral asymmetry increases.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Avoid aggressive roll maneuvers below 225 knots with any asymmetric external load.<br>Releasing the controls, feet off rudders, and retracting the speedbrake should recover the aircraft from most departures. If post departure oscillations continue, retard the throttles to idle to minimize engine stall. Consider locking the harness and grasping the left and/or right canopy bow handles to help stabilize the body. Do not use feet on rudder pedals as unintentional rudder can aggravate an out−of−control condition. Check altitude, AOA, airspeed and yaw rate for indications of recovery or development of a stabilized out−of−control mode. Post departure gyrations are characterized by large, uncontrollable changes in angle of attack and indicated airspeed, accompanied by sideforces and interchanging AOA and yaw rate tones.

Left/right oscillations are greater if the aircraft enters the low speed condition with one wing pointed towards the ground.<br>High Subsonic Mach and Low AOA - At high subsonic Mach and below 5° AOA, violent nose-slice departures occur if controls are misapplied (abrupt full coordinated control inputs combined with forward longitudinal stick) during rolling maneuvers at less than 1g. Initial departure motion is extremely rapid with no warning to the pilot. The departure is extremely violent and may result in overstress or airframe damage.<br>High Subsonic Mach and High AOA - With lateral weight asymmetries near 6,000 foot−pounds the F/A−18B/D has increased departure susceptibility at high subsonic Mach numbers (greater than Mach . 0.7). Yaw away from the heavy wing can occur above 25° AOA and above Mach 0.7, becoming moresevere at higher Mach numbers and may be difficult to counter with opposite pedal. Aggressive roll maneuvers into the heavy wing at greater than Mach 0.8 and greater than 25° AOA can produce yaw/roll motion away from the heavy wing that cannot be countered with full lateral stick or pedal inputs. The basic airframe directional stability is low in this region and aggressive high AOA maneuvering can lead to violent departures from controlled flight. Maneuvering should be terminated and controls neutralized immediately if yaw rate accelerates significantly or at onset of the yaw rate warning tone to avoid departure.<br><br>. 11.2.3 OCF Recovery. Post departure dive recovery must be initiated at no less than 6,000 feet AGL.<br><br>to assure safe ground clearance. If passing 6,000 feet AGL and dive recovery has not been initiated, eject. There is no buffer associated with the 6,000 foot mandatory ejection altitude. The 6,000 foot altitude addresses only altimeter errors, aircraft maximum recovery capability, and ejection seat capability. Delaying the ejection decision below 6,000 feet AGL while departed may result in unsuccessful ejection. Safe recovery may not be possible with flight control system failures. If safe post departure dive recovery is in doubt, eject. All indications of recovery must be present (AOA and yaw rate tones removed, all side forces subsided, and airspeed accelerating above 180 knots) before rolling upright to recover. For post departure dive recovery, minimum altitude loss is achieved by advancing throttles to MAX and maintaining 25 to 35° AOA until a positive rate of climb is established. If the store loading configuration prescribes an AOA limit below 35°, that lower limit should be used for recovery. If altitude loss is not critical, use less AOA and MIL power to reduce the chance of a follow−on departure because of potential asymmetric thrust, FCS failure and/or lateral asymmetric loading.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-10.<br><br>

The new software improved recovery from OCF, making recovery from vertical slow speed departures benign in the two−seat centerline tank configured aircraft. The Falling Leaf mode is characterized by repeated cycles of large, uncommanded roll−yaw motions which reverse direction every few seconds. At each reversal the crew will sense high sideforce accompanied by near zero g. Entry into a sustained inverted Falling Leaf (predominately negative AOA) mode is highly unlikely.<br>The F/A−18 has a weak nose−down pitching moment capability in the 45 to 55° AOA region, and this capability is further reduced with an aft CG and/or external store loading. However, Falling Leafs have occurred at both forward and aft CGs. Susceptibility to entering the Falling Leaf mode is also increased with centerline tank loadings because of increased tendency for roll−yaw oscillations, which drive the large amplitude AOA oscillations exhibited in the Falling Leaf mode. This mode may be encountered after post departure gyrations during the final stages of spin recovery, or near zero airspeed (vertical) maneuvers.<br>Flight controls should remain released until recovery from a Falling Leaf is indicated. Extraordinary patience is required since the amount of nose−down pitch control power available for recovery is low due to the strong nose−up inertial pitch coupling generated in this mode. The upright/positive AOA Falling Leaf mode is the most common Falling Leaf mode. Large altitude loss may occur because of the high rate of descent which can exceed 20,000 ft/min. Positive indications that the aircraft is recovering are an increasing nose low attitude and an increasing peak airspeed. Recovery is normally preceded by the presence of a strong side−force coupled with an unload in a very nose low or slightly inverted attitude. During the Falling Leaf mode, transient spin arrows may be present. Do not chase the transient arrows as recovery may be delayed.<br>Chasing transient spin recovery arrows delays recovery.

The low yaw rate spin mode is characterized by AOAs in the 50 to 60°.<br><br>range and a very low oscillatory yaw rate (0 to 40°/second). AOA excursions below 50° AOA may sometimes occur. This mode can be very smooth, although some mild pitch, roll and yaw oscillations are normally experienced. The low rate spin is not typically violent or disorienting. Low cockpit forces and a low yaw rate make this mode difficult to recognize as a spin. An oscillatory low yaw rate spin may be confused with a Falling Leaf.

Beyond the AOA limits for lateral asymmetries, there is increased susceptibility to entering a low yaw rate spin. Recovery characteristics are essentially the same as for symmetrically loaded aircraft. Prompt application of full antispin lateral stick will generate spin recovery in approximately one turn. Spins will be autorotative with the lateral asymmetries of approximately 10,000 ft−lbs or more. If recovery controls are not promptly applied, higher yaw rates generated by greater lateral asymmetry may result in rapid progression into the intermediate yaw rate spin mode.<br><br>. 11.2.5.2 Intermediate Yaw Rate Spin. Entry into an intermediate yaw rate spin is unlikely in clean.<br><br>or symmetric store loadings. Entry into this spin mode is more likely with large lateral asymmetry. Spin motion is characterized by higher average yaw rates (20 to 80°/second). In some cases, yaw rate may repeatedly oscillate through zero as spin rotation continues in one direction.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-12.<br><br>

            In a highly oscillatory intermediate yaw rate spin, automatic engagement of the spin recovery mode may be delayed or inhibited if yaw rate repeatedly oscillates through zero. Manual selection of the spin recovery mode (SRM switch to RCVY) may be required if the SRM does not engage automatically.<br>The intermediate yaw rate spin is also very oscillatory in pitch and roll. AOA typically varies between 40 and 80° with bank angle excursions of ±60° or more. Bank angle variations may increase to the point where the aircraft executes one or more 360° rolls while continuing to spin. Rate of descent may be as high as 21,000 feet/minute with altitude loss of approximately 1,500 feet per turn. Cockpit side force may be as high as 1 g. While spinning, the aircraft will unload (negative g) during the 360° rolls. Due to the highly oscillatory motions and rapid variations in cockpit forces, this spin mode may be very disorienting, particularly if aircrew are not securely strapped in. Asymmetric store loading intermediate yaw rate spin characteristics are essentially the same as that of a symmetrically loaded aircraft. However, spins into the light wing are autorotative at asymmetries greater than 10,000 ft−lbs.<br><br>. 11.2.5.3 High Yaw Rate Spin. The high yaw rate spin mode is characterized by yaw rates in the 100.<br><br>to 140°/second range and AOAs up to 80 to 90°. This mode is best described as a smooth flat spin.<br>Small oscillations in pitch and roll occur but are not generally perceived by the pilot. Longitudinal forces in the cockpit can be as high as −3.5 g (eyeballs out). Consequently the pilot will be significantly hindered in recovery unless the shoulder harness is manually locked. In the high yaw rate spin mode, identification of the mode and turn direction is not difficult. Rate of descent for an established high yaw rate spin averages 18,000 feet/minute (1,000−1,500 foot/turn). Entry into this mode is possible only with sustained (more than 15 seconds) full pro−spin lateral stick with the spin recovery switch in RCVY or with very large lateral asymmetry.<br>With a centerline tank, the high yaw rate spin may be much more oscillatory. Oscillations may be as much as ±50° pitch and ±125° roll at 100 ±30°/second yaw rate. Due to the large roll rate and yaw rate oscillations, recovery may be delayed by entry into a Falling Leaf during the final stages of spin recovery. It is extremely important that yaw rate be reduced to near zero in order to promptly recover from the Falling Leaf.<br>High yaw rate spin characteristics for symmetric and asymmetric store loadings are similar with a few noteworthy exceptions. With lateral asymmetry of 18,000 ft−lbs or more, entry into this spin mode may occur if AOA limits are exceeded. The spin is autorotative, but even with a 18,000 ft−lbs spin, recovery can be obtained in less than two turns. Altitude loss is approximately 1,500 feet per turn. Spin recovery characteristics and capability above 18,000 ft−lbs lateral asymmetry are unknown.<br>. 11.2.5.4 Inverted Spin. The F/A−18 is extremely resistant to inverted spin entry. In symmetric storeloadings, short duration SRM arrows (approximately 1 spin turn) have been encountered following inadvertent departures, typically from slow speed vertical flight. A steady state inverted spin is highly unlikely and requires full pro−spin controls. However, if a steady state inverted spin is encountered, it exhibits a yaw rate of approximately 30°/second, negative 50° AOA, rate of descent of 21,000 feet/minute, and altitude loss of 3,500 feet/turn. Spin recovery requires approximately one spin turn following application of antispin controls, stick in direction of spin recovery arrow (away from the spin).<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-13.<br><br>

            . 11.2.5.5 Spin Recovery. Full lateral stick in the direction of the spin recovery arrow must be applieduntil spin rotation rate is at or very near zero to minimize inertial pitch coupling and provide maximum nose-down pitching moment for rapid recovery. Spin recovery lateral stick should be smoothly neutralized when spin arrows are removed. Spin rotation should be completely stopped for rapid recovery and to preclude redeparture.<br>Conditions which indicate recovery from any of the spin modes are:<br>. 1. AOA and Yaw rate tones removed.. 2. Side forces subsided.. 3. Airspeed accelerating above 180 knots.<br>. 11.2.5.5.1 Spin Recovery Mode (SRM). Flight characteristics in SRM differ significantly from those.<br><br>of the normal CAS mode. All FCS feedbacks, interconnects, and gain schedules are removed, leaving the FCS in essentially a three axes DEL mode. Because the artificial yaw stability features of CAS are not available in SRM, the directional stability is weak and the nose tends to wander. Because the lateral control surfaces are not washed out with increasing AOA as they are in CAS, lateral stick can generate excessive yaw. The aircraft is very susceptible to nose−slice departure with even small stick deflection. Maintaining AOA less than 20° will significantly reduce the departure potential. An aft CG increases the possibility of entering into a Falling Leaf if departure occurs. However, holding antispin input after yaw rate ceases may result in a redeparture.<br>To prevent entering a Falling Leaf, do not intentionally operate in the spin recovery mode if the CG is aft of 25% MAC.<br>Recovery from any of the upright spin modes with the FCS in CAS is likely due to low yaw rate spin protection logic. This logic feeds antispin commands to the rolling surfaces in response to uncom- manded yaw rate. With the FCS in SRM, spin recovery characteristics may be more rapid. The command arrow on the DDI indicates the correct stick position for recovery from either an upright or inverted spin. Antispin controls are as follows: for upright spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full lateral stick with the spin direction (i.e., right upright spin, right lateral stick); for inverted spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full lateral stick opposite the spin direction (i.e., inverted left spin, use right lateral stick). In SRM, application of lateral stick in the direction of the command arrow causes a rapid reduction of yaw rate. After the yaw rate is stopped, forward stick may be required to reduce the AOA below stall.<br>With the spin recovery switch in NORM, the SRM disengages when the command arrow is removed.<br>The CAS automatically drives the stabilators to full trailing edge down during the final stages of spin recovery. However, it may not be possible to reduce AOA before yaw rate is completely stopped because of inertial pitch coupling, especially with an aft CG. Recovery from the high yaw rate spin mode requires approximately 2½ turns. Intermediate and low yaw rate spin modes require a correspondingly lesser number of turns for recovery. Approximately 12,000 to 14,000 feet may be required for recovery from a fully developed spin (from application of recovery controls to bottom of dive pullout).<br><br>. 11.2.5.5.2 Manual SRM.

If the switch not returned to NORM, a tendency to overcontrol laterally may be present until airspeed increases above approximately 245 KCAS when the FCS reverts to CAS.<br>With the spin switch in RCVY (SRM engaged), departure susceptibility is greatly increased. A departure during the dive recovery is likely if the spin recovery switch is not returned to NORM. Both the manual and automatic SRM provide spin recovery in less than 1½ turns (full antispin controls) for lateral asymmetry up to 10,000 ft−lbs. However, with lateral asymmetry of 11,500 ft−lbs or more, spin recovery becomes more diffi- cult. At this asymmetry, premature neutralization of controls causes the spin to reestablish itself in the original direction. Antispin controls should be maintained until the yaw rate ceases.<br><br>. 11.2.5.5.3 Spin Recovery Command Arrows. During highly oscillatory post−stall gyrations, spins,.<br><br>or spin recovery, the spin recovery command arrows may temporarily appear. The pilot should not attempt to chase these transient command arrows as this may cause inadvertent application of pro−spin controls and delay recovery. Under these conditions, the controls should be left released until the command arrow is verified steady. If/when the direction of the command arrow becomes steady and the pilot has visually confirmed spin type (upright or inverted) and spin direction, prompt application of full anti−spin lateral stick should then be applied.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-15.<br><br>

Engine failure or shutdown with flaps AUTO results in no degradation in.<br><br>handling qualities under most circumstances at low AOA. A small amount of yaw trim may be required to counter asymmetric thrust effects. At high AOA, engine failure results in a yaw toward the failed engine that is controllable by quickly reducing the AOA and countering the yaw with rudder.<br><br>. 11.3.1.2 HALF or FULL Flap Configuration. Single Engine Minimum Control Speed (Vmc) is the.<br><br>airspeed required to maintain controlled flight with only one operating engine. Because the engines are not located on the centerline of the aircraft, if only one engine is operating, the unbalanced force of that engine causes the aircraft to yaw. The rudders are the primary flight control surface that can be used to counter the yaw caused by the operating engine. However, if the aircraft’s airspeed becomes too slow, the rudders cannot generate enough control power to oppose the yaw caused by the operating engine.<br>The slowest airspeed at which the rudders can provide enough control power to counter the yaw produced by the operating engine is the single engine minimum control airspeed. As AOA and lateral weight asymmetry increase, the minimum airspeed required to ensure aircraft single engine control also increases. In other words, for a given airspeed and configuration, lateral directional control is ensured if AOA is maintained below a critical level. With flaps HALF, maintaining AOA at or below 12° provides sufficient control in almost all circumstances. In flaps FULL, control can be lost above 10° AOA at light gross weights and large lateral weight asymmetries. In both cases, exceeding the critical AOA results in large bank angle/sideslip excursions and/or inability to arrest yaw/roll rates. A slight reduction in AOA, however, quickly restores controllability with little or no loss of altitude.<br><br>. 11.3.1.3 Single Engine Waveoff. During single engine waveoffs (MIL or MAX) up to full rudder may.<br><br>be required to counter sideslip. Lateral stick may be required to maintain wings level flight, but inputs should be kept under half stick deflection to avoid inducing adverse yaw. Pilots must be careful not to over rotate and reach angles of attack where lateral directional control power is reduced. Loss of lateral and directional control may occur above 12°AOA with flaps HALF and above 10° AOA with flaps <br>FULL.<br><br><br>. 11.3.2 FCS Degraded Modes (DEL/MECH). The full authority control augmentation system is.<br><br>automatically backed up by the direct electrical link (DEL) flight control mode with a digital system and an analog mode for backup aileron and rudder control. DEL operation results from the lack of reliable feedback data or operation within the FCS. DEL operation will usually only occur in one axis (pitch, roll, or yaw), however yaw DEL will initiate roll DEL. If DEL fails, the mechanical link (MECH) automatically provides roll and pitch control through a direct input from control stick to the stabilator actuators, bypassing the flight control computers and stabilator actuator servo valves. Detailed descriptions of the causes of FCS DEL/MECH modes is contained in Chapter 15.<br>In digital DEL the trim rates are noticeably slower than in CAS, but should allow neutral trimmed flight throughout the airspeed envelope. Damping of aircraft motion occurs only as a result of natural aircraft stability so the tendency to enter PIOs is increased, especially at high speeds. Rapid control inputs (stick, rudder and throttle) should be avoided as they may aggravate aircraft oscillations.<br>Normal formation flight and refueling operations are possible as long as caution is exercised with in−close corrections to prevent oscillations from developing. In pitch DEL, use of speedbrake should be avoided to prevent moderate longitudinal oscillations, unless required in extreme situations for g control.

            In pitch DEL there is very little stabilator authority available. Therefore, the g available is extremely limited.<br>Roll rates are significantly reduced at airspeeds above Mach 0.94 in roll or roll plus yaw DEL and may be as low as 65°/second.<br>For landing, flying qualities in DEL will be degraded. Consideration should be given to lowering the landing gear and flaps (HALF) with sufficient time to evaluate approach flying qualities. During approach in roll DEL the aircraft is easily excited in roll, resulting in a constant 2 or 3° roll oscillation.<br>There is also no roll limiting, so lateral inputs will produce a noticeable increase in roll rates and roll response that could lead to a lateral PIO if large rapid inputs are used. No more than half lateral stick or rudder pedal is recommended due to excessive sideslip and dutch roll buildup. Excessive sideslip can be generated with maneuvering above on−speed AOA. After a bolter in pitch DEL a large pitch up will occur which can be countered with forward stick.<br>Mechanical operation (MECH ON) can be the result of FCS failure, complete electrical failure, or as a result of pulling FCC channels 1 and 2 circuit breakers. MECH ON is possible with or without ailerons and rudders operative. If no surface hardover failures occur, reversions into MECH ON are normally characterized by a rapidly increasing aft stick force, stabilized at 3 to 5 pounds for flaps AUTO, and 15 to 25 pounds in the landing configuration, and an increased control sensitivity in the pitch axis. Aft stick force can be trimmed out, but expect stick to move and in the landing configuration very little aft stick authority will remain. The stick force per g gradient is higher than a normal CAS aircraft, but will allow adequate maneuvering performance. Speedbrake use can lead to severe longitudinal PIO. Rapid power changes resulting in trim changes will aggravate the PIO tendency.<br>Lateral stick inputs will couple into the pitch axis as a nose up rotation that can be countered with forward stick. For landing HALF flaps will provide better flying qualities. After a bolter in pitch MECH a large pitch up occurs which can be countered with forward stick. Landing without aileron or rudder operative, approach speeds are much higher than normal at on−speed AOA and nosewheel steering is inoperative.<br>. • Reversion to MECH ON has often resulted in large pitch-up orpitch-down transients.<br>. • Resetting the FCS while in MECH may result in large pitch-up orpitch-down transients.<br><br>. 11.3.3 Loss of INS data to FCCs. If INS pitch and roll angles are not available due to INS or MUX.<br><br>bus failures, or if the FCS detects a problem with the INS data, the sideslip rate calculation defaults to a backup that only uses roll and yaw rates.

Leading edge flap (LEF) asymmetries can occur when one of the.<br><br>LEF hydraulic drive units (HDU) stalls/fails or the mechanical interconnect between the inboard and outboard LEF surfaces fails. The most common LEF asymmetry results from a weak LEF HDU that stalls (stops moving due to aerodynamic loading) during abrupt longitudinal maneuvers at high airspeed and low altitude. When this happens, a roll-off away from the failing HDU as AOA or g is increased followed by an abrupt roll-off in the opposite direction is typical. Failure detection logic in the v10.7 FCS software is designed to provide advanced warning of a LEF asymmetry; however, during extremely abrupt maneuvers, an HDU stall may not be detected in time to allow the pilot to abandon the maneuver and avoid a large roll transient.<br>During landing approach, maintaining on-speed or slightly fast approach AOA results in the best flying qualities for any off-schedule symmetric or asymmetric LEF configuration. With a LEF failure and flaps in AUTO, the LEF and TEF symmetric commands will freeze and the differential LEF and TEF commands will continue to be commanded. With the FLAP switch set to HALF or FULL, the failed LEF will remain frozen while the functioning LEF, the TEF and the aileron droop commands will schedule normally. Due to increased buffet levels with flaps FULL, HALF flap landings are recommended with LEF failures. When transitioning from flaps AUTO to HALF, yaw/roll motion may be encountered that can be countered with small lateral stick inputs. Roll-off may also be encountered during AOA/pitch attitude changes.<br><br>. 11.3.5 Trailing Edge Flap Failures. For a trailing edge flap (TEF) failure the TEF surfaces are.<br><br>hydraulically commanded to zero degrees. Dynamic pitch characteristics will be more sensitive due to loss of flap scheduling and roll performance will be degraded. For landing, approach characteristics will be severely degraded. Aileron droop and aileron to stabilator interconnect will not function. For shipboard operations, a divert to field landing may be required due to excessive approach speeds.<br><br>. 11.3.6 Gain Override. While not a failure mode, GAIN ORIDE is prescribed for certain AOA or.<br><br>pitot−static sensor failures to provide better or more predictable handling qualities. With flaps AUTO, selecting GAIN ORIDE results in fixed gains that correspond to Mach 0.70, 35,000 feet and 2° AOA.<br>Longitudinal and lateral response is slightly more sluggish as airspeed is reduced below these values and is slightly more sensitive as airspeed is increased above these values. Regardless, handling qualities remain very good within the 10° AOA and 350 KCAS NATOPS limits for GAIN ORIDE operation. If the airspeed limit is exceeded, self-sustaining pitch oscillations will start and aircraft will become uncontrollable if airspeed is allowed to continue to increase. If the AOA limit is exceeded, departures are likely since the fixed values of the air data and AOA severely reduce departure resistance.<br>Additionally, the aircraft will stall at a higher than normal airspeed due to the fixed position of the LEFs. Be aware that in GAIN ORIDE, no departure warning tone is initiated at either 15° AOA with FLAPS HALF or 12° AOA with FLAPS FULL.<br>Transition to or from the landing configuration should be done in level flight at 200 KCAS.<br>Transition should not be made while in a bank angle due to the higher than normal aft stick forces required to maintain flight path angle. Sideslip excursions may also occur if flap transition is made in a turn.<br>With the flaps HALF, GAIN ORIDE results in fixed gains that correspond to 8.1° AOA. Handling qualities are best at these conditions and degrade slightly away from on-speed AOA. Small deviations from 8.1° cause slight handling characteristics degradation, as the aircraft will be less sensitive to <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIV-11-19.<br><br>

            longitudinal inputs. Flight is not recommended above 200 KCAS with flaps HALF due to these characteristics. LEF are fixed at 17° and will not vary with airspeed and AOA. TEFs and aileron droop are fixed at 30°. Aircraft should remain below 15° AOA to avoid unintentional departures.<br>With the FLAP switch in FULL, aircraft should remain below 160 KCAS and 12° AOA. Do not exceed 15° AOA. Flight at 8.1° AOA results in the best control characteristics. Small deviations from . 8.1° cause slight handling characteristics degradation, as the aircraft is less sensitive to longitudinalinputs.

            CHAPTER 12.<br><br><br>General Emergencies.<br><br><br>. 12.1 GENERAL.<br><br>Part V contains procedures to correct an abnormal or emergency condition. While these procedures provide guidance in dealing with an emergency; they should be modified, as required, in case of multiple/combined emergencies, adverse weather, or other peculiar factors. Use common sense and sound judgment to determine the correct course of action.<br>Unless specifically stated in NATOPS, BLIN or MSP codes shall not be used for in-flight decision making.<br><br>Apply the following rules to all emergencies:<br><br>. 1. Aviate: first and foremost, maintain aircraft control.. 2. Analyze the situation and take proper action. Perform immediate action procedures withoutdelay; however, initially do only those steps required to manage the problem. When operating a control, be prepared to immediately return the control to its former setting if an undesirable response occurs.<br>. 3. Navigate: land as soon as practical, unless the situation dictates otherwise.. 4. Communicate: As soon as possible, notify the flight lead, ship, ATC (air traffic control), or towerof the emergency, aircraft position, and intended course of action. Relay emergency indications, actions taken, flight conditions, power setting, etc., as time permits.<br><br>. 12.1.1 Immediate Action Items. Procedural steps preceded by an asterisk (*) are considered.<br><br>immediate action items. Pilots shall be able to accomplish these steps without reference to the Pocket <br>Checklist (PCL).<br><br><br>. 12.1.2 Warnings, Cautions, and Advisories. Warnings, cautions, and advisories are displayed in the.<br><br>cockpit on the LDDI, on the upper warning/caution/advisory lights panels, or on the lower right caution lights panel. Certain cautions provide two indications: one on the LDDI and one on the lower right caution lights panel.<br>Warnings, cautions, and advisories are categorized and are listed alphabetically by category in figure 12-1 together with cause, remarks, and corrective action. Potential cause(s) for the associated warning/caution/advisory is indicated by a bullet (•) under the Cause/Remarks column. The categories <br>are as follows:<br><br>a. Warning Lights.<br>b. DDI Cautions and Caution Lights not associated with FCES or HYD cautions.<br>. c. Flight Control Electronic System (FCES) Cautions.. d. Hydraulic System (HYD) Cautions.e. DDI Advisories.<br>f. Advisory Lights.<br>g. CFIT Voice Warnings <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-12-1.<br><br>

            DDI cautions and advisories are listed in CAPS. Warning, caution, and advisory lights are distinguished by a box around the legend (e.g., ).<br>Where appropriate, voice aural warnings are listed in quotation marks with their respective warning or caution. If a DDI caution or caution light starts with a single letter (for example L, R, P, or Y) that letter is not used to place the caution alphabetically.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-12-2.<br><br>

System activation secures fuel to the APU, arms the fire bottle, and discharges the bottle after a 10 second delay. Discharge is delayed to al- low the APU time to spool down before extinguish- ing agent is introduced.<br>Since the fire extinguishing system requires 28 vdc essential bus power, the fire bottle may not be dis- charged if the BATT switch is turned OFF during the 10 second delay time.<br>IN FLIGHT or ON GROUND . *1.

If the hook is unlocked (HOOK handle down) but fails to leave the up position, an arrest- ing hook system failure may be applying HYD 2B pressure to hold the hook up. For this reason, pull- ing the HOOK circuit breaker deenergizes the hook selector valve and ensures HYD 2B pressure is re- moved.<br>If the arresting hook snubber is not properly charged, the arresting hook may not fully extend due to airloads and HYD 2B back-pressure. In this case, if reducing airspeed does not extinguish the HOOK light, shutting down the right engine re- duces HYD 2B back-pressure and should increase arresting hook extension. After engine restart, the hook may retract at a maximum rate of 2° minute.<br>If the HOOK light remains on after this procedure and a visual inspection confirms that the hook is <br>partially extended, a successful arrestment is pos-.<br><br>sible due to g-loads at landing.<br><br>IN FLIGHT.<br><br>. 1.

Any delay in activating the engine anti-ice system can result in ice accumulating rapidly on the IGVs and shedding into the engine when the system is turned on. Ice accumulation on LEFs is similar to the inlet lip and can serve as an indication of how much ice may be on the inlet. As little as 0.5 inch of ice ingested by the engine from the inlet lip can result in compres- sor stalls and major FOD.<br>With ice clearly visible on the LEFs, reducing throttle settings below 80% N2 rpm while descend- ing below the freezing level should generate suffi- cient inlet spillage to shed inlet ice outside the inlet and not into the engine. Similarly, avoiding throttle transients above 90% N2 rpm, abrupt maneuvers, and bank angles over 20° should help prevent ice from detaching from the inlet lip and being in- gested by the engines.<br>With no ice visible on the aircraft, an INLET TEMP of at least +5°C should provide sufficient aerodynamic heating to prevent ice accumulation on the LEFs and inlet lips.<br>. 1.

(The autopilot, and rudder toe/ flare are inoperative.) Following a rudder actuator failure, the surface is driven to a faired position by air loads and is damped to prevent oscillations. With one rudder failed, the roll- ing surface to rudder interconnect (RSRI) may not have sufficient rudder authority to coordinate lateral stick inputs. Countering a rolloff with lateral stick alone in- creases adverse yaw and aggravates the rolloff. The only way to ensure balanced flight is to minimize sideslip by the early and proper use of the operating rudder.<br>If a dual channel rudder actuator failure is reset, the failure could be triggered again and reappear with se- vere yaw, roll and pitch transients during critical flight phase(s). Transients occurring close to the ground could be unrecoverable. During the takeoff and landing phases, any ejection decision should be made early.<br>Once configured for landing, maintain on-speed and balanced flight.<br>Failure to maintain AOA below 10° and balanced flight may result in a departure in yaw and roll that is unre- coverable, even with full opposite rudder and stick. Be- cause of the rate at which AOA and sideslip buildup can occur in this configuration, the safe ejection enve- lope can be rapidly exceeded during the takeoff and landing phases.<br>If single engine, departure is probable with the use of afterburner.<br>Lineup control is degraded with left or right rudder failed. Ensure all lineup corrections are performed slowly and smoothly.<br>Minimize large, rapid throttle inputs. If single engine, large throttle transients will cause significant yaw and roll, making heading control difficult.<br>Rudder toe-in or out will not be available for takeoff or landing. Due to a lack of rudder toe-in, bolter perfor- mance may be degraded. The autopilot will be inopera- tive.<br>. 1. Execute Controllability Check procedure. (Do notexceed flaps - HALF.) . 2.

If a fire occurs during hot refueling, the pilot must decide whether to taxi clear or shut down immediately.<br><br>. 13.3.1 HOT BRAKES/BRAKE FIRE. Hot brakes and/or melted wheel assembly fuse plugs can be.<br><br>expected any time maximum effort braking is used at heavy gross weights with or without anti-skid, e.g., aborted takeoff or heavy weight landing with high taxi brake usage.<br>There are basically two types of fires related to the brake system: flash fires and fires due to continuous hydraulic fluid leakage onto hot brakes.<br>Brake flash fires are normally short in duration and self-extinguish. They can occur if excess grease or residual/leaking hydraulic fluid have built up in the wheel brake assembly or on the carbon discs.<br>These materials may ignite at normal post-landing brake temperatures. Visible flames may extend from the wheel assembly while flammable material is being consumed and smoke may be visible for a short time after the fire goes out.<br>Continuous hydraulic fluid leakage coming into contact with hot brakes may result in a fire which will not immediately self-extinguish. Setting the parking brake increases the rate of heat transfer from the brakes to the wheel assembly which may lead to continuous hydraulic fluid leakage.<br>. • Avoid setting the parking brake with hot brakes until the brakeassembly has cooled to prevent damage by heat and/or fire to the brakes, wheel, tire, and landing gear components.<br>. • If fire occurs with the parking brake set, the parking brake maybecome non-operational and the aircraft may need to be chocked.<br>If hot brakes are suspected - . 1. Continue to taxi to cool brakes (if practical).. 2. DO NOT set parking brake.. 3. Chock nosewheel (do not chock main wheels).. 4. Park into the wind (if practical).. 5.

            CHAPTER 14.<br><br><br>Takeoff Emergencies.<br><br><br>. 14.1 EMERGENCY CATAPULT FLYAWAY.<br><br>Off the catapult, several emergencies may cause the aircraft to settle and/or lose lateral directional control. Aircraft settle may be the result of insufficient catapult endspeed or loss of thrust by the engines. Lateral directional control may be degraded by FCS malfunctions or engine thrust asymmetry.<br>Accordingly, a single engine malfunction may be characterized by settle and reduced controllability.<br>Priorities during emergency catapult flyaway are to establish control of aircraft, arrest settle, and accelerate for climbout. Establishing control of the aircraft is predicated on arresting roll and yaw rates. Full rudder pedal input opposite yaw/roll may be required to do so. Rudders are the only means of controlling yaw, and are effective in countering roll, therefore they should be used as the initial control input. If rudders are not sufficient to control roll, judicious lateral stick inputs can be used to supplement the rudders and will help control bank angle. However, large lateral stick inputs may produce adverse yaw and exacerbate controllability.<br>Angle of attack is critical to maintaining aircraft control and arresting settle. AOA must be high enough to minimize altitude loss, while low enough to ensure controllability. An AOA range of 10-12° provides the best compromise, although at the high endspeeds associated with launches at and above 49,000 lbs gross weight, momentary excursions of up to 13° do not endanger controllability. The recommended catapult stabilator trim settings correspond to reference AOAs between 10° and 12°. For catapult launches at or below 48,000 lbs gross weight, a ″hands off″ rotation will result in peak AOAs of about 12° followed by a reduction toward 10° to 11°. For catapult launches at and above 49,000 lbs gross weight, peak AOAs of about 13° will occur followed by a rapid reduction to 12°. Thus, the aircraft will seek a desirable flyaway AOA without pilot input. In most cases, proper AOA control is automatically provided by the flight control system, however several scenarios (mis-trimmed aircraft, AOA system failure, flight control malfunction) require the pilot to actively set the flyaway attitude.<br>Pilot cues are insufficient to enable precise AOA control during flyaway, so pitch attitude becomes the primary means to prompt longitudinal inputs. Maintaining the waterline symbol 10° above the horizon results in acceptable AOA control. If lateral directional control effectiveness is lost at this nose attitude, a slight reduction in pitch of approximately one degree should result in immediate recovery of control effectiveness and restore aircraft control.<br>Stores jettison is crucial to emergency catapult flyaway. Timely emergency jettison minimizes altitude loss and improves controllability by reducing weight and lateral asymmetry in many configurations.<br>If flyaway airspeed available - . *1.

EJECT.<br><br>Delay in determining controllability will likely place aircraft outside the ejection envelope.<br><br>. 14.2 ABORT.<br><br>The decision to abort or continue takeoff depends on many items specific to the emergency.

Items to be considered include the following:<br><br>Emergency condition.<br><br><br>Weight.<br><br><br>Speed.<br><br><br>Runway remaining.<br><br><br>Braking conditions.<br><br><br>Arresting gear availability.<br><br><br>Wind.<br><br><br>Weather.<br><br>Normally, the abort is accomplished by placing the throttles to IDLE, extending the speedbrake, and applying the brakes. If speed is above the computed maximum abort speed from part XI and an arrestment must be done in order to stop, the seriousness of the emergency and good judgement will control whether to abort or continue the takeoff. The ejection seat provides safe escape at ground level.<br>If a safe aborted takeoff cannot be made and takeoff is impossible, eject. Make an arrestment if there is any stopping problem. Lower the hook in time for it to extend fully (normally 1,000 feet before wire), tell the tower of the intention to arrest, and line up on runway centerline.

The go around procedure provides a quick simple way to safely get airborne if a situation arises which requires immediate action and is not covered by another procedure. Use military or maximum power while considering the current configuration (asymmetry) and the time/distance available to get airborne. If large control inputs (rudder or aileron) are used prior to liftoff, be prepared to adjust them once airborne. Jettison of external stores may enhance single engine performance.

EMERG JETT button - PUSH (if required)<br>. 14.4 LOSS of DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING TAKEOFF or LANDING (BLOWN TIRE, NWS.<br><br><br>FAILURE).<br><br>A directional control problem on takeoff or landing may be caused by a NWS, brake, landing gear component failure, planing link failure or a blown tire. Directional control problems may be compounded by wet or icy runways, crosswinds, hydroplaning, high lateral weight asymmetries, or single-engine operations. It may be difficult to identify the source of the problem, and time is usually critical. The decision whether to continue a takeoff or to abort, or on landing, to continue rollout depends on the speed at the time the directional control problem is detected, the stopping distance required, and the availability of arresting gear.<br>Loss of brakes may be caused by a brake or anti-skid system failure. A brake system failure may cause a locked brake and/or blown tire, resulting in ineffective braking and/or loss of directional control. A blown tire may cause engine FOD or flap and gear door damage. If decision to stop is made, the primary danger is loss of directional control. For Planing Link Failure procedures, refer to chapter . 16.If the decision to takeoff is made, nose rotation and/or takeoff may be delayed by abnormal aircraft attitudes due to failures, increased drag, and lack of or reduced rudder toe due to rudder deflection to counter directional motion.<br>If detected after touchdown and flyaway airspeed available - . *1.

If an engine fire is indicated by a FIRE warning light, throttle affected engine OFF. A fire may be confirmed if the FIRE warning light stays on with the throttle OFF, or the light goes off and the system checks bad. For dual FIRE light cases where the pilot is unable to discern which FIRE light came on first, throttle left and right engine to as low as practical for flight and check engine instruments for engine condition. Once affected engine is determined, throttle affected engine OFF. Prior indications of high fuel flow, high EGT, rough running, or smoke and fumes may also confirm a fire. If engine stall is indicated, immediately place the throttle to OFF. Do not press the FIRE light again, as this will reopen the fuel shutoff valve.<br>With an engine fire, lower hook as soon as possible. Excessive heat on hook release cable may make it impossible to lower the hook.

The afterburner has continuous ignition and attempts to light any time the throttle is above 50% afterburner and the afterburner is not lit. If afterburner does not light after selection or blowout, reduce throttle to MIL and reselect afterburner when in a better environment.<br><br>. 15.3 UNRESPONSIVE ENGINE.<br><br>A unresponsive engine may remain at high or low power or the power may vary randomly. There may be uncommanded throttle movement, the throttle may freeze, or throttle movement may have no effect. In the landing pattern, be prepared for an unexpected single-engine waveoff, landing, or bolter.<br>If the engine fails to MIL after deselecting afterburner, the MIL power lockup system may be the cause. Slowing to 250 knots and lowering the landing gear may allow normal engine operation.<br>If the cause of loss of engine control is a severed throttle cable, control may be gained via ATC. For ATC to engage, the PLA of each engine must match within 10 °, and both throttles must be less than MIL and greater than IDLE. Aircrew can approximate the parameters required by matching engine N2 <br>RPM.<br><br>If thrust is too high to permit landing, shut down the engine with the throttle. If the engine cannot be shut down with the throttle, press the FIRE light.<br><br>. 15.3.1 ENGINE STUCK AT MIL (AFTER DESELECTING AFTERBURNER).<br><br><br>RIGHT ENGINE.<br><br>. 1.

Refer to Single Engine Approach and Landing procedure.<br>. 15.4 ENGINE FAILURE.<br><br>If an engine fails, the corresponding generator and HYD 1 (left engine) or HYD 2 (right engine) system will be lost. Either generator supplies sufficient power to operate all electrical items. A windmilling engine can cause repeated flight control transients as the hydraulic switching valves operate. Various FCS cautions will come on intermittently. After the rpm has decreased to near zero, the transients will cease, the FCS cautions will go off, and FCS operation will be normal. To prevent repeated switching valve cycling, avoid stabilized flight where engine windmilling rpm produces hydraulic pressure fluctuations between 800 to 1,600 psi. If control of a surface is lost due to a frozen or sticking switching valve, attempt to unstick the valve by gently cycling the flight controls, and reset the FCS. If the failed engine core is rotating freely and rpm is below 30%, use the APU or engine crossbleed to retain both HYD systems. If the right engine is being rotated with crossbleed to provide normal systems operation and fuel flow on the left engine is reduced below 2,000 pph (as during landing), the right engine hydraulic pump may not provide sufficient flow for nosewheel steering and normal brakes. Refer to Hydraulic Failure, this chapter, for results of loss of a hydraulic system. During engine crossbleed, the feed tank of the failed engine may not gravity transfer to the operating engine feed tank. To prevent this, gravity transfer from the inoperative feed tank may be initiated by discontinuing crossbleed if the failed engine AMAD operation is not required or interrupting fuel feed to the failed engine system by pressing the failed engine FIRE button. Extended operation with the FIRE button pressed may result in a corresponding L or R AMAD caution.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-3.<br><br>

            If both engines fail, both generators will drop off line as rpm decays through 60%. Refer to Double Generator Failure, this chapter, for results and procedures. A minimum of 12%N2 is required for ignition. At least 350 knots is required to maintain 12% rpm. If rpm has decayed below 12%, airspeeds significantly greater than 350 knots may be required to regain 12% rpm especially at lower altitudes.<br>If conditions do not allow for a 350 knot descent, APU restart is the last alternative. Refer to Restart procedures, this chapter.<br><br>. 15.5 ASYMMETRIC THRUST EFFECTS.<br><br>During single engine flight with external stores, consideration should be given to dump fuel and stores jettison to reduce gross weight, reduce drag and/or alleviate an aggravating asymmetrical loading. Close attention to airspeeds is required in all loadings to maintain airspeed at or above single engine maximum endurance speed (5.6 to 5.8° AOA). Maneuvering should be limited to that required to return to base using shallow bank angles and avoiding turns into the failed engine. In straight and level flight at zero bank angle, some amount of rudder deflection and/or trim will be required to offset the yawing moment from asymmetrical thrust. A slight (up to 5°) bank into the good engine should reduce this rudder requirement. A straight-in half-flap approach should be performed.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. • Failure of the variable exhaust nozzle in the full open positionadversely affects single and dual engine performance. No cautions are available to the pilot except for VEN position indications on the <br>EMI/IFEI.<br><br>. • Single engine waveoffs and bolters with F404-GE-402 (EPE) enginesinstalled may require full rudder and coordinated lateral stick to control aircraft yaw and roll produced by asymmetric thrust.<br><br>. 15.6 ENGINE STALL.<br><br>An engine stall is a disruption of airflow that has resulted from mechanical damage to the engine or adverse flight conditions. Adverse flight conditions that can cause stalls include high altitude, low airpeeds, high sideslip or high angle of attack, usually in combination with throttle transients, especially, the throttle chop/re-advance combination. Stalls may occur in the engine fan or high pressure compressor and are one of two types: pop or surge stalls, and hung stalls.<br>Pop or surge stalls - The majority of stalls are pop or surge stalls. These are usually indicated by airframe vibration, engine surges, engine noises such as loud banging, or momentary exhaust fireballs.<br>The engine almost always recovers on its own within 2 seconds without any pilot corrective action.<br>Hung stalls - Hung stalls occur infrequently. They may initiate from a pop stall and are detectable as a lack of response to throttle movement and/or rpm rollback and EGT increase. Without corrective action, engine rpm may eventually stabilize near or below idle rpm.<br>Due to inadequate turbine cooling during the stall, a prolonged hung stall (over 1 minute) can result in turbine overtemperature damage without indicating an EGT overtemperature.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-4.<br><br>

With both engines in a stalled condition, one or both generators may be inoperative. With one generator inoperative, shut down and restart the engine with the inoperative generator first.<br>If the stall does not clear itself, a prompt chop to IDLE may clear it. Checking for stall clearing at idle involves observing a drop in EGT with the NOZ position opening to the idle position, followed by normal response to the throttle. If the stall cleared at idle, the likelihood of engine damage is extremely remote, and the affected engine may be used for approach and landing as required.<br>. *1. Throttle affected engine - IDLEIf the stall does not clear - . 2. Throttle affected engine - OFF. 3. Refer to Single Engine Approach and Landing procedure.If the stall clears - . 2. Check engine response at a safe altitude.. 3. Land as soon as practical.<br>. 15.7 RESTART.<br><br>Ignition is on with throttle at IDLE or above and rpm between 12% and 45% with engine flamed out. At least 350 knots is required to maintain 12% rpm. Continuing automatic restart attempts at high altitude or high AOA may cause the engine to overtemp. In this case, place the throttle OFF until in a better start environment. The optimum restart envelope is below 25,000 feet. If the engine is shut down from a high power setting and rpm decays to 0%, temporary rotor binding may occur. In this case, engine rotation will not be regained until the engine cools evenly (about 10 to 15 minutes). If crossbleed is not used, airspeeds significantly greater than 350 knots may be required to regain 12% rpm especially at lower altitudes. APU restart is the last alternative.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Windmill restart attempts made after rpm has degraded to 0% may require up to 450 knots to obtain 12% rpm for ignition.<br>If APU restart is required, HYD ISOL ORIDE should first be selected for 10 seconds prior to APU start, assuming good HYD 2B. With the APU switch ON and the green READY light on, the engine crank switch may then be used to crank the engine for restart. The APU restart envelope is below 250 knots, below 10,000 feet.

            . 15.8 POWER TRANSMISSION SHAFT (PTS) FAILURE.<br><br>Failure of the PTS will result in the display of the associated GEN, BOOST LO and both HYD circuit cautions. If the shaft does not fail at the design shear point, it could be flailing. A flailing PTS could damage flammable fluid components in the engine bay which could result in an engine bay fire.<br>Consideration should be given to shutting down the associated engine to minimize the risk of an engine bay fire.<br><br>. 15.9 HYDRAULIC FAILURE.<br><br>Hydraulic failures are indicated by displaying HYD 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B circuit cautions either singly or in combinations. Failure effects can be analyzed by referring to figure 15-5, Hydraulic Flow Diagram, and figure 15-6, Hydraulic Subsystems Malfunction Guide. Failures which affect flight controls may also cause an FCS caution. Remarks regarding the flight control effects due to hydraulic failures are shown in figure 15-7.<br>Dual circuit cautions in the same system may indicate a pump failure or reservoir depletion. Refer to the hydraulic system pressure gage to determine if pressure fluctuations are present. If system pressure has decreased to zero with no fluctuations, the pump shaft has probably sheared from the AMAD and no further action is required.<br>Stabilized system pressure below 2,000 psi or fluctuations in system pressure is indicative of a failing hyd pump that has yet to shear. This may result in overheating the pump and a subsequent AMAD bay fire. Securing the associated engine will minimize the potential for pump overheat.<br>Dual circuit cautions in the same system preceded by circuit caution sequencing is probably an indication of a fluid leak in a part of the system not protected by reservoir level sensing (RLS). This leak can not be isolated and all the hydraulic fluid in that system will be lost. If this occurs, the circuit A caution comes on and, sometime later, goes off and the circuit B caution comes on. As the fluid continues to leak, the circuit B caution goes off and for a relatively short time (less than 7% of the time since the circuit A caution first appeared), both circuits A and B operate and hydraulic pressure indicates normal since there is a small amount of fluid remaining in the reservoir. When pressure drops below approximately 1,500 psi, both circuit A and B cautions come on. To summarize, the sequence of indications during an unisolated hydraulic fluid leak is: (1) only HYD 1A (2A) on, (2) only HYD 1B (2B) on, (3) both off, and (4) HYD 1A (2A) and HYD 1B (2B) on. Prolonged flight following display of both cautions may result in overheating the pump and subsequent AMAD bay fire. Securing the associated engine if prolonged flight is anticipated minimizes the potential for pump overheat.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>When an engine is secured in flight, the corresponding HYD 1 (left engine) or HYD 2 (right engine) system is lost and the associated hydraulic cautions HYD 1A 1B (left engine) and HYD 2A 2B (right engine) appear as rpm decreases to near zero. If the hydraulic cautions were not present prior to securing the engine and a failure or leak in the associated hydraulic system is not suspected, the FCS may be reset to attempt to regain a failed control surface and unstick a frozen or sticking valve.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-9.<br><br>

            . 15.10 FUSELAGE FUEL LEAK.<br><br>The possibility of fire is normally of prime concern with any fuel leak. However, with a massive leak, the fuel loss itself must be dealt with promptly and correctly to ensure that sufficient fuel remains to return to base. Fuel loss rates in excess of 1000 lbs/minute have been observed from failed main fuel lines. Since leaks may occur upstream of the throttle-operated fuel shutoff valve in the fuel control, shutting down the throttle may not correct the problem. Depressing a FIRE light closes the airframe-mounted fuel shutoff valve for that engine at the feed tank and stops fuel flow through the main fuel line. Depressing the good-side FIRE light may result in flameout of both engines.<br>The pilot may not be able to visually determine which side is leaking. Use a wingman, when available, and check for secondary indications to determine the side of the leak. Cockpit indications <br>may include any or all of the following:<br><br><br>D L/R BOOST LO caution.<br><br><br>D L/R AMAD caution.<br><br><br>D FUEL LO caution.<br><br><br>D Rapid decrease of fuel quantity in one feed tank.<br><br><br>D Erratic engine operation at high power settings.<br><br><br>D Abnormal fuel flow indications.<br><br>Land as soon as possible.

Failure of fuel transfer from either tank.<br><br>1 or 4 will result in the fuel quantity in the failed tank remaining higher than normal. Fuel from the good transfer tank will keep both engine feed tanks near full. This prevents gravity transfer from the failed transfer tank. When the good transfer tank empties, the failed transfer tank can gravity transfer to its feed tank. The engine on the good side is now supplied from only its feed tank while the engine on the bad side is supplied from both its feed tank and the associated transfer tank thru gravity transfer. This causes the feed tank on the good side to reach the FUEL LO level first unless the throttle on the good side is reduced. Since gravity transfer from tank 1 or 4 is less than engine demand at high power, it is possible to have as much as 700 pounds of unusable fuel for approach and landing after failed tank 1 transfer or 2,500 pounds after failed tank 4 transfer. With 2,500 pounds remaining in tank 4, the center of gravity may be aft of the aft limit. Since fuel dump from either tank 1 or tank 4 to correct this condition is not possible, asymmetric thrust must be used to balance fuel in the feed tanks.<br>. 1. Use higher power on engine whose feed tank has most fuel (tank 2 feeds left engine, tank 3 feedsright engine).<br>Depletion of either feed tank may result in AMAD overheat and loss of hydraulic and electrical power supplied from that engine.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-16.<br><br>

In this case, the generators will not reset until the radar is turned OFF. On aircraft 163119 AND UP, a double generator failure with WOW results in the battery switching off after 5 minutes. If a double generator failure occurs on a catapult shot or during field takeoff that is not aborted and if the battery switch remains ON, all electrical power is lost 5 minutes later and the flight controls revert to MECH ON. In this case it is advisable to switch to ORIDE until commencing final approach and then switch back to ON. The battery will then remain on for another 5 minutes. Should the battery switch off, power can be regained for another 5 minutes by switching to OFF or ORIDE and back to ON.<br>Monitor the voltmeter for emergency and utility battery status.<br><br>. 15.17.2 Transformer-Rectifier Failure. Failure of both transformer-rectifiers can be recognized by.<br><br>the loss of the HUD, bleed air system, and FCS channels 3 and 4 with an FC AIR DAT caution on the DDIs.

            generators or transformer-rectifiers fail, the FCS will switch to MECH ON after 7 to 10 seconds unless the battery switch is placed to ORIDE. The utility and emergency batteries will provide limited dc power for about 20 minutes. On aircraft 161702 AND UP with double transformer-rectifier failure, time is not critical since the U battery and battery charging TRU will power the start and essential buses. If either battery charge is low or the battery switch is in ORIDE, time will be less. The time may be extended by reducing electrical load. Minimize trim actuation and UHF transmission. Consider turning battery operated equipment off where practical. Equipment requiring ac power only will remain operable with a double transformer-rectifier failure and need not be turned off to conserve battery power. After setting speed between 200 to 300 knots, the FCS CHAN 1 and FCS CHAN 2 circuit breakers may be pulled. This shuts down all electrical flight control after 7 to 10 seconds and the system reverts to MECH ON where all control is with the mechanical differential stabilators (ailerons/rudders inoperative). Ensure FCS CHAN 1 and CHAN 2 circuit breakers are both reset prior to landing. If system does not reset to CAS, attempt FCS reset. Higher than normal pitch attitudes and/or high fuel consumptions results in an extremely aft CG (possibly aft of the CG limit depending on the flight condition).<br>Extreme caution should be used in MECH ON with ailerons/rudders inoperative.

            . 15.18 AMAD CAUTION.<br><br>An L AMAD or R AMAD caution indicates that the left or right AMAD oil is too hot. Low altitude flight on a hot day with less than 4,000 pounds fuel may cause an AMAD caution. A climb to cooler air may reduce AMAD oil temperature. An over-serviced AMAD, AMAD heat exchanger failure, hot fuel recirculation system failure, or motive flow system failure will cause an AMAD caution. An empty feed tank or BOOST LO caution will cause loss of AMAD cooling.<br>Prolonged operation of a hot AMAD may result in an engine bay fire.<br>Continued operation with an AMAD caution may cause loss of the associated generator. If an AMAD caution is accompanied by generator loss, land as soon as practical. If a landing cannot be made within 15 minutes after an AMAD and GEN caution, consider shutting down the associated engine. The engine may be restarted for landing, but should be shut down as soon as the aircraft is stopped. See <br>Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1.<br><br>During ground operation after flight, an AMAD caution may occur due to the lack of ram air cooling and low fuel state. Below 1,000 pounds fuel remaining and above 30°C, an AMAD caution will appear almost immediately. Above 3,000 pounds of fuel remaining and below 30°C, an AMAD caution should not occur. Between these conditions, the time before an AMAD caution will appear is a function of fuel state and ambient temperature (15 minutes at 24°C and 2,000 pounds fuel). Lower fuel quantities and higher ambient temperatures will reduce the time before an AMAD caution will appear. Shutting down an engine (left engine shutdown preferred) will extend the ground operating time. If the AMAD caution appears, shut down the associated engine.<br><br>. 15.19 AMAD PR CAUTION.<br><br>An L AMAD PR or R AMAD PR caution indicates the left or right AMAD oil pressure is low. The AMAD can operate 30 minutes after loss of oil without a catastrophic failure but the generator will fail shortly after loss of oil. Although it is documented the AMAD can operate for 30 minutes after loss of oil without catastrophic failure, pilots may want to consider shutting down the affected engine even if within 30 minutes of landing. A L/R AMAD PR caution could be an indication of an AMAD oil leak which may result in an engine/AMAD bay fire. See Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1.<br><br>. 15.20 OXYGEN LEAK (Aircraft 161353 THRU 164068).<br><br>An oxygen leak can cause liquid oxygen to flow through the heat exchanger and into the cockpit.

Another source of smoke or fumes is an electrical malfunction or overheat of equipment located in the cockpit. In the event of an electrical short or overload condition, this equipment may generate electrical smoke (usually white or gray in color) but should not cause an open fire since cockpit equipment uses very little electrical current.

            . 15.28 ADC FAILURE EFFECTS.<br><br>An ADC failure is recognized by the BIT advisory and the BIT page indication of ADC-MUX FAIL (C/D), NO GO (A/B) or NOT RDY. The standby instruments indicate the correct altitude and airspeed. The HUD airspeed, barometric altitude, vertical velocity and mach information are lost. The landing gear warning light and aural tone are activated if the landing gear handle is up. To silence the tone push the warning tone silence button or slow below landing gear extension speed and extend the landing gear. E bracket data is automatically provided by the flight control computer and the ATC mode is functional. The AOA indexers will be inoperative. The INS velocity vector is adversely impacted by the loss of ADC data and may be inaccurate after approximately 10 minutes. See BIT advisory, figure 12-1.<br><br>. 15.29 FCS FAILURE INDICATIONS AND EFFECTS.<br><br>FCS failures are indicated by BLIN codes and/or various cautions and when selected, the FCS status display on the DDI (figure 15-10). The FCS status display should be used to determine the precise failure immediately upon indication of an FCS malfunction. BLIN codes are not always accompanied by cautions or Xs.<br><br>. 15.29.1 Invalid FCS Status Display.<br><br>With the failure of channels 1 and 3, the FCS status display will show the word INVALID in place of the G-LIM advisory. Subsequent FCS failures or resets will not be displayed. Diagnosis of failure <br>state can be made using the following:<br><br>If INVALID on the FCS and flying quality has degraded - Check if stick moves with longitudinal trim. If stick movement occurs the stabilator has reverted to mechanical control, and the ailerons and rudders are off. Refer to MECH ON caution. If FCES is illuminated on the annunciator panel, channel 2 or 4 is still functioning. Ratio changer HI GAIN only is available. If FCES is not illuminated on the annunciator panel, a four-channel or four-processor failure has occurred. Ratio changer LO GAIN only is available. In both cases the T/O trim button is inoperative.<br>The presence of the INVALID in place of the G-LIM advisory indicates that the FCS will stop using INS provided data across the MUX; for this failure there is no significant degradation to flying qualities, departure resistance or roll performance with these failure indications.<br>FCS status displays are shown in figure 15-10.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-34.<br><br>

            . 15.30 FCS FAILURE.<br><br>The reliability of the FCS is very high and, when failures do occur, they usually occur singly. No single failure will affect flying qualities. The flight control system has multiple redundancy and is designed to fail to the least critical configuration. Two flight control computers each have two flight control channels. Within each channel, each axis (pitch, roll, or yaw) is separate so that failure of one axis does not affect the other two. If normal CAS functions fail, each computer also provides a digital direct electrical link (DEL) between stick inputs and flight control surfaces. If roll or yaw digital DEL fails, the computers provide an analog DEL to the ailerons and rudders. If pitch digital DEL fails, a direct mechanical link from the stick to the differential stabilator actuators provides limited pitch and roll control. When a rudder or aileron actuator fails, the actuator degrades to a failed/flutter damped mode. The failed rudder or aileron will be slowly forced back to the faired position by aerodynamic loads. This failed/flutter damped failure mode has not been flight tested. Depending on which failures have occurred, flying qualities may be considerably degraded. Due to the variety of possible failure combinations, exact guidance cannot be given to cover every possible circumstance. However, specific procedures have been established for each FCS caution. See the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1, for appropriate action. Each instance requires individual judgement as to the flyability of the particular failure combination.<br><br>. 15.31 AOA PROBE DAMAGE.<br><br><br>. 15.31.1 AOA Indications with AOA Probe Damage. Pilots should be alert for AOA probe damage.<br><br>after IFR basket impact during refueling, bird strikes, or icing conditions. Damage can result in AOA being declared invalid and AOA display inaccuracies. If AOA probe damage is ever suspected, an AOA/airspeed crosscheck, in the landing configuration, should be made with a wingman, if possible.<br>Crosschecking with flaps AUTO may give a satisfactory crosscheck, but the probe can be bent in such a way that AOA anomalies are accentuated in the landing configuration. If AOA damage is suspected, follow the FLAP SCHED procedures. Also, with a declared AOA failure, ATC with flaps HALF or FULL is not available and selection should not be attempted.<br><br>. 15.31.1.1 FCC OFP Functionality. With flaps in AUTO, the FCC uses a split of >10° true AOA.<br><br>between the left and right AOA probes to declare AOA invalid. This failure in flaps-AUTO is <br>characterized by the following indications:<br><br>. • FCS caution. • Four channels of AOA are Xd out on the FCS status display.. • HUD AOA numeric display blanked.. • L and R AOA probe values lined out.<br>NOTE.<br><br>An AOA probe split is determined by local AOA probe measurements and not the true AOA values provided for display on FCS status page.<br>True AOA values displayed on the FCS status page are approximately . 0.65 times local AOA values. Therefore, a split of 15.5° between localvalues approximates a 10° split between displayed true AOA values.<br>When flaps are HALF or FULL, there is a difference in thresholds used by the ADC and FCCs. An AOA can be declared invalid by the FCCs for splits as low as 3.3°. The FCC’s split threshold will increase with sideslip. However, the ADC will consistently use a split threshold of 10° before declaring <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-45.<br><br>

The FCCs can still declare an AOA failure if the split is greater than 3.3°.<br>In HALF or FULL, a split between the AOA probes that is >3.3° and <10° is characterized by the <br>following indications:<br><br>. • FCS caution. • Four channels of AOA will be Xd out on the FCS status display. (Xs will latch.)In HALF or FULL, the HUD AOA numeric display and E−bracket are normally driven by the average of both probes but will be blanked when AOA is declared invalid by both the ADC and FCC.<br>This occurs when the split between the AOA probes is >10°, and is characterized by the following <br>indications:<br><br>. • FCS caution. • Four channels of AOA will be Xd out on the FCS status display.

Irrespective of flap state, the ADC will declare AOA.<br><br>invalid if the AOA probes differ by >10°. Unlike FCC declared AOA failures, ADC declared AOA failures are not latched. ADC monitored AOA values can drift in and out of validity with maneuvers that cause the AOA probe splits to drift inside and outside the 10° threshold. As a result, the E-bracket, AOA numeric, indexer light and approach lights may blank and re-appear as the split crosses the threshold.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Only when the ADC declares the AOA invalid will the indexer and external approach lights will be blanked.<br>L and R AOA probe values from the ADC and the INS AOA (center) value are displayed on the FCS status page. Whenever the ADC declares the AOA invalid, the L and R AOA values will continue to be displayed but they will have a line through them. The INS AOA value will not be lined out and will always be displayed irrespective of AOA anomalies.<br>An individual probe can be selected to drive the AOA E-bracket. Probe selection is accomplished by selecting GAIN ORIDE and pushing the AOA pushbutton to box and select the desired probe. The pilot can compare the INS AOA value against the L and R AOA values to determine which probe to select.

Once a probe is selected, that probe will remain selected regardless of ADC AOA validity. The HUD E-bracket and AOA numeric will continue to be displayed as long as GAIN ORIDE and a probe is selected.

When an AOA probe-split occurs within 12 seconds of.<br><br>takeoff (WoffW), FCC AOA is set at a fixed value of 10° and flaps-transition is inhibited, regardless of FLAP switch position, to prevent undesirable transients. The AOA probe-split threshold used by the FCC can be as little as 3.3° depending on sideslip. Two to ten seconds after WoffW, the FCS caution appears and all four AOA channels X-out on the FCS status display. The FCS will switch from using the fixed AOA value of 10° to using an estimated AOA value, calculated by the FCC, when an FCS reset <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-47.<br><br>

The ADC can produce erroneous signals without any cautions or advisories if the pitot static probes sustain damage. HUD displayed airspeed may be inaccurate without error indications. Airspeed checks with a wingman should be made in the landing configuration if a damaged pitot static probe is suspected. Crosschecking in the cruise configuration may give a satisfactory crosscheck, but the probe may be bent in such a way that pitot static anomalies are accentuated in landing configuration.<br>The standby airspeed indicator receives signals from the left pitot static probe, so it will be accurate if only the right probe is damaged. If the left probe is damaged, the static source selector can be used to select the static pressure source from the right probe. The static source lever allows selection of right (BACKUP) or left (NORMAL) secondary static pressure to be applied to the standby indicated airspeed indicator, standby pressure altimeter, and standby vertical velocity speed indicator. With lever in the horizontal position, the selector valve is in NORMAL, with lever in the vertical position, the selector valve is in BACKUP.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>A detached pitot static line may cause malfunctions similar to those caused by a damaged pitot static probe.

Direct electrical link (DEL) operation results from the lack of reliable feedback data or operation within the FCS. DEL operation will usually occur in only one axis but yaw DEL operation forces the roll channel into roll DEL. In the DEL mode, pilot inputs position the control surfaces as a direct function of pilot input.<br><br>. 15.33.1 Digital DEL - DEL ON Caution. The digital roll DEL function is activated for any one of the.<br><br>following conditions: three roll rate gyro failures, reversion to digital yaw DEL, or reversion to analog yaw DEL. The digital yaw DEL function is activated for a three yaw rate gyro failure condition. The digital pitch DEL function is activated for any one of the following conditions:<br>With flaps in AUTO: three pitch rate gyro failures, or three normal accelerometer failures.<br>With flaps in HALF or FULL: three pitch rate gyro failures.<br>. 15.33.2 Digital DEL. If the FCS reverts to pitch DEL at transonic or supersonic speed, decelerate to400 knots/Mach 0.8 to reduce the longitudinal PIO tendency. If the FCS reverts to roll and yaw DEL at transonic or supersonic speeds, slowly decelerate to below 400 knots/Mach 0.8 to reduce the uncomfortable sideforce oscillations due to weak dutch roll damping.<br>In pitch DEL there is very little stabilator authority available. Therefore, the g available is extremely limited.<br>The use of the speedbrake in pitch DEL should be avoided, since it will normally lead to moderate longitudinal PIO. However, the speedbrake can be used for a 1 g incremental increase if required in an extreme situation. The trim rates are noticeably slower than in CAS, but they will allow neutral trimmed flight throughout the airspeed envelope. Damping of aircraft motion occurs only as a result of natural aircraft stability and is not enhanced by the FCS. Pilot inputs should be gentle at higher airspeeds since rapid inputs may aggravate the aircraft oscillations. Rapid power changes should be minimized as they may result in aggravation of PIO tendency due to trim changes. In roll and yaw DEL the use of the rudder is not recommended due to control sensitivity and dutch roll excitation. In pitch DEL, lateral stick inputs will couple into the pitch axis as a nose up rotation and will require a corresponding pitch input to correct.

Minimize in-close corrections during air refueling to prevent PIO.<br>Roll rates are significantly reduced at airspeeds above Mach 0.94 in roll or roll plus yaw DEL and may be as low as 65°/second.<br>For carrier or field landing, fly on-speed with flaps HALF. After a bolter in pitch DEL a large pitch up will occur which can be stopped with forward stick force. A similar pitch up will occur after a field landing and the pilot must consciously keep the aircraft on the ground; once stabilized after touchdown normal roll-out procedures can be used. Recommend field landings be conducted using a reduced sink rate to minimize the pitch up tendency. During approach in roll DEL the aircraft is easily excited in roll, resulting in a constant 2 or 3° roll oscillation. There is also no roll limiting, so lateral inputs will produce a noticeable increase in roll rates and roll response. The increased roll response may lead to a lateral PIO if large rapid inputs are used. Do not use more than ½ lateral stick or rudder pedal in approach configuration in roll DEL or roll plus yaw DEL, due to excessive sideslip and dutch roll;<br>however, small timely rudder inputs can be used to dampen directional oscillations. Minimize maneuvering above on-speed when in roll and yaw DEL due to magnitude of sideslip generated.<br>Jettison asymmetric wing stores. Minimize rapid power applications during approach in roll and yaw DEL with asymmetric stores as they will couple into the directional axis creating uncomfortable side forces. Do not exceed +12° AOA during approach maneuvering with asymmetric stores. Recommend a reduced sink rate landing with a short field arrestment when landing with asymmetric stores.<br>If a waveoff is carried out in pitch DEL, the pilot encounters a substantial stick force change during flap retraction. Almost full aft stick is required to maintain level flight.<br>For shipboard landings fly a straight-in approach with flaps HALF at on-speed AOA. The ability to effectively fly the aircraft with degraded flight controls increases significantly with time (steep learning curve). Consider lowering the gear and flaps (HALF flaps) early to evaluate the approach flying qualities. The ACLS/ILS needles would be used to ensure proper lineup by the “in the middle” positions. The LSO waveoff window should also be moved farther out such that only small glideslope/lineup corrections are required from the “in the middle” position.<br><br>. 15.33.3 Analog DEL. The FCS reverts to analog roll DEL and analog yaw DEL if there are three.<br><br>digital processor failures. In addition the analog roll DEL function is activated if three channels to the ailerons are Xd out and the analog yaw DEL function is activated if three channels to the rudders are Xd out. If the aircraft selects yaw DEL, the control laws also activate the digital roll DEL function. The flying qualities described for digital DEL (DEL ON caution) may or may not apply to this configuration. There is no analog pitch DEL mode.<br>If yaw analog DEL is active, the pilot’s rudder pedal provides direct rudder control. If roll analog DEL is active, the pilot’s lateral stick provides direct aileron control.

An aileron hinge failure may be suspected if a sudden uncommanded roll-off combined with yaw and pitch occurs without an AIL OFF or FCS caution, a ″Flight Controls, Flight Controls″ alert or associated FCS Xs or BLIN codes. If the hinge has failed, it is likely that a portion of or all of the aileron surface will detach from the wing. However, aileron actuator functionality may be unaffected. The aileron position indicator on the FCS page will indicate the position of the actuator rod-end, even though the control surface is no longer attached. The only way to confirm this failure is a visual check of the suspected aileron surface to determine if the aileron surface is still attached and responding to control inputs.<br>Aileron surface departure may result in structural damage to the wing, empennage or fuselage.

            Piloted simulation with a missing aileron has shown that flying qualities are degraded but adequate for all flap settings below 10° AOA. Lateral stick against the roll and rudder pedal in the opposite direction to counter side force buildup will be required for balanced flight. Aircraft response to normal control inputs is uncoordinated and roll performance will be more sluggish when rolling away from the detached/missing aileron. Lateral stick inputs will result in directional excursions. Lateral-directional motion will be lightly damped. Flap transitions to AUTO at low airspeeds and high gross weights may result in unrecoverable departure. If aileron damage occurs immediately after takeoff, selecting MAX throttles when airspeed is less than 220 KCAS and delaying selection of flaps AUTO until the flaps have scheduled up (above 250 KCAS) minimizes the risk of departure. Minimizing gross weight by jettisoning stores and maximizing acceleration improves flying qualities through the flap transition region.<br>Flap transition to AUTO below 250 KCAS can result in large roll and yaw oscillations leading to unrecoverable departure, particularly at higher gross weights.

If no surface hardover failures occur, reversions into MECH ON are normally characterized by a rapidly increasing aft stick force, stabilized at 3 to 5 pounds for flaps AUTO and 15 to 25 pounds in the landing configuration (on-speed).

The LEF braking system is not designed to function beyond the over−travel stop. Any deflection beyond the over−travel stop could potentially deflect to a full structural limit of approximately 55°. With only the outboard section of the LEF failed up beyond the design limits, it has been shown that aircraft can be controllable in the landing configuration with HALF flaps.<br>Failures that result in extreme inboard LEF leading edge up deflections are highly susceptible to departure at airspeeds below 250 KCAS. The minimum controllable airspeed depends on the severity and configuration of the LEF failure. The only way to confirm extreme LEF failures is by visual check as the FCS indications will be inaccurate or blanked. Use care to maintain airspeed above 300 KCAS while assessing the LEF positions. Extreme failure of the inboard section of the LEF will result in immediate uncommanded roll and yaw that can be controlled with pilot input (lateral stick against the roll and rudder pedal in the opposite direction, countering side force buildup) given adequate airspeed.<br>As airspeed decreases, roll and yaw moments will build, leading to a departure. Flight data shows that extreme failure of the inboard LEF, with or without the failure of the outboard section, to a position leading edge significantly up (beyond about 45°) results in an uncontrollable aircraft below approxi- mately 250 KCAS in flaps AUTO. With flaps HALF, limited flight data indicate high buffet loads (to the point of not being able to read the HUD) at airspeeds of approximately 190 KIAS, and an abrupt departure at airspeeds slightly below 190 KIAS in this configuration.<br>The Rolling Surface to Rudder Interconnect (RSRI) in the flight control software may complicate an inboard LEF failure by attempting to coordinate the roll commanded by the pilot input (lateral stick) to counter roll−off. Simulation data shows that selecting GAIN ORIDE with flaps AUTO reduces RSRI commanded input and provides additional rudder control authority, which may allow controlled flight to slower airspeeds. Therefore, controllability checks in GAIN ORIDE with flaps AUTO are recommended. Reduce gross weight to the maximum extent possible prior to performing controllability checks. Landing in GAIN ORIDE with flaps AUTO with LEF failure has not been flight tested. Expect degraded flying qualities. Only a real−time controllability check can determine whether the individual LEF failure experienced will be controllable all the way to touchdown. Carrier landing is not recommended. Extreme caution is recommended because there is little to no warning of impending departure. This failure condition has never been flight tested.<br>Leading edge up deflections of the inboard LEF beyond the 4° over−travel stop may result in an uncontrollable configuration below 250 KCAS. Selecting GAIN ORIDE with flaps AUTO may provide control- lability at slower airspeeds. There may be little warning of impending departure as airspeed decreases. Immediate ejection may be required.<br><br>Departure will be unrecoverable.<br><br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Any deflection beyond the over−travel stop could potentially reach a full structural limit of approximately 55° leading edge up.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-58.<br><br>

            . 15.38.2 LEF FAILED (WITH INBOARD POSITION LESS THAN 4° UP) OR TEF FAILED.<br><br>If the LEFs are locked in a more up−position than the automatic flap schedule dictates, then stall and departure AOA are lower (as low as 10° AOA if the LEFs are at 0°). Buffet with the LEFs at 0° is moderate at about 7° AOA. Use care to prevent AOA excursions above 10°. With the LEFs locked at 20° to 30° down, landing−configuration handling qualities are essentially normal. Even with the outboard section of the LEF failed up beyond the design limits, the aircraft can be controllable in the landing−configuration with HALF flaps.<br>With a LEF lockout/failure, upon selecting HALF−flap position, the functional LEF as well as the functional TEFs will extend normally. However, the failed/locked−out LEF remains frozen creating an asymmetric flight control surface condition that can be countered with lateral stick and trim. If the AUTO flap position is then selected, after selecting HALF or FULL, the functional LEF/TEFs do not retract until GAIN ORIDE is selected. If fuel is a concern (as with CV cyclic operation), selecting GAIN ORIDE with FLAP switch in AUTO allows all non−failed flaps to retract to a more fuel conserving 3°/3° position. Returning GAIN ORIDE switch to normal returns functional TEFs to normal scheduling, but as long as there is a failed/locked LEF, the functional LEF remains in the GAIN ORIDE position. With the GAIN switch in ORIDE above 350 knots an uncontrollable divergent pitch PIO may occur. With the FLAP switch AUTO, ORIDE provides 3°/3° flaps.<br>In the event of a TEF failure, the failed TEF trails to its neutral uplock position. To prevent asymmetry, the functional TEF is also shut off and trails to its neutral uplock position as well. With a TEF failure, if the TEFs are more up than the automatic flap schedule dictates, the aircraft attitude is more nose−up than normal at any given airspeed in AUTO. In the landing configuration, the approach speed is much higher at on−speed AOA. An AOA of 10° to 11° may be used for landing, but the over−the−nose field of view is reduced.<br><br>. 15.39 FLAP SCHED CAUTION.<br><br>See the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1. The FLAP SCHED caution indicates the flaps are not scheduling properly. It is always accompanied by a Master caution and FCS caution. Air data failures will also cause the FLAP SCHED caution to be asserted.<br>With an air data failure, without GAIN ORIDE selected, the rudders go to full 30° toe in at touchdown which may result in an uncommanded nose pitch-up.<br>The FLAP SCHED caution is asserted if either the left or right LEF is off schedule (difference between the LEF position/command is greater than 10° with AOA above 12 degrees). A FLAPS SCHED caution accompanied by BLIN 221 provides a good indication that an off−schedule LEF caused FLAPS SCHED caution. PROM 10.7 never asserts a FLAP SCHED caution for AOA probe splits as the FCC will continue scheduling the flaps based on an AOA estimate. The FLAP SCHED caution remains for six seconds after the failure condition clears. AOA probe splits never assert a FLAP SCHED caution because the FCC will continue scheduling the flaps based on an AOA estimate.<br>For all FLAP SCHED cautions, establish straight and level flight then check handling qualities.

Transition to the landing configuration at 200 knots, straight and level at a safe altitude, and check flying qualities. Aircraft response may be sensitive near 200 knots but will probably be about normal at ON-SPEED AOA. If AOA is failed, leading edge flaps and rudder toe-in are scheduled by an AOA approximation for 1 g flight.

The NWS caution comes on when nosewheel steering is shut off due to detection of a failure in the system. Emergency high gain nosewheel steering is available after an FCS channel 2 or 4 failure. To engage the emergency mode, pull the failed channel circuit breaker, unlock the wings, and press the NWS button.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>If pressing the NWS button results in an FCS caution and single X in the powered channel, emergency HI gain steering is not available.<br>The NWS remains engaged in the high gain mode after the NWS button is released. The emergency mode can be disengaged by pressing the paddle switch. The emergency mode should be engaged only for low speed taxi. Emergency HI gain operation prevents detection of NWS command failures so be alert for uncommanded steering. Press the paddle switch immediately upon detection of uncom- manded steering.<br>Nosewheel steering is not available with a HYD 2 failure. The NWS caution does not come on but the NWS cue on the HUD flashes. A flashing cue does not necessarily indicate failed nosewheel steering since the cue flashes with either an MC1 failure, or a HYD 2A and HYD 2B failure.<br><br>. 15.41 AILERON FAILURE/AIL OFF CAUTION.<br><br>See the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1. When an aileron fails, the surface is driven to the faired position by air loads and is damped to prevent oscillations. If the ailerons were drooped, the functional aileron is driven to the undrooped position. With both ailerons undrooped, approach speed will increase about 8 knots in Flaps FULL, and 16 knots in Flaps HALF. The functional aileron continues to assist in providing control. Roll damping is noticeably less. Use care to prevent overcontrol and resulting lateral PIO, especially when approaching touchdown.<br><br>. 15.42 JAMMED CONTROLS.<br><br>Stick inputs are position sensed and a jammed stick prevents normal control. If the linkage to the mechanical servo valve is jammed, an override spring cartridge allows stick motion. If the stick is jammed, trim provides ample authority for controlled flight. The autopilot, except for control stick steering, may also be used for aircraft control.<br><br>. 15.43 OUT-OF-CONTROL FLIGHT (OCF).<br><br>Departure from controlled flight can result in fully developed out−of−control flight.

A wingman visual inspection (if available) and a controllability check should be performed following a violent departure.<br><br>. 15.43.1 Departure. The aircraft has departed when it is not properly responding to control inputs.<br><br>Releasing the controls, taking feet off rudders, and retracting the speedbrake recovers the aircraft from most departures. Continued control inputs in this situation aggravate the situation and delay recovery. It is imperative that a departure be recognized immediately and the Departure Recovery procedure executed. If the aircraft does not respond to released controls after allowing 5 to 10 seconds for post-stall gyrations to cease, it may be in a Falling Leaf or spin. Reanalyze the situation. Execute the appropriate recovery procedures.<br><br>. 15.43.2 Falling Leaf. The Falling Leaf mode may be encountered during departure recovery, during.<br><br>the final stages of spin recovery, or following zero airspeed (vertical) maneuvers. This mode is characterized by repeated cycles of large, uncommanded yaw/roll motions which reverse directions every few seconds. At each reversal, the crew will sense high side-forces accompanied by near zero g.<br>Repeated crew observations of this sensation on both sides of the aircraft confirm the Falling Leaf mode. The upright/positive AOA Falling Leaf mode is the most common Falling Leaf mode. Entry into the inverted/negative AOA Falling Leaf mode is highly unlikely. It is possible to get transient spin arrows during the Falling Leaf mode. During controls released recovery testing, average altitude loss prior to indications of recovery was 5,000 feet with the maximum altitude loss being 12,000 feet.<br>Extraordinary patience is required during recovery. Positive indications that the aircraft is recovering are an increasingly nose low attitude and increasing peak airspeed. Recovery is normally preceded by the presence of a strong side-force coupled with an unload in a very nose low or slightly inverted attitude.<br>Chasing transient spin recovery arrows will delay recovery. Do not chase the spin arrows.<br><br>. 15.43.3 Spin. The spin mode is the least often encountered out-of-control mode of the F/A-18. Spin.<br><br>is confirmed by the presence of a sustained yaw rate, fluctuating AOA, pegged turn needle and airspeed less than 150 knots. Yaw rate may be difficult to determine initially due to oscillation but should exhibit a predominant direction as spin rotation continues. When a spin has been visually confirmed, DDIs should be checked for a command arrow, and if present, full lateral stick should be applied in the direction of the arrow to provide anti-spin controls. The command arrow, by itself, is not confirmation of a spin because during the most violent departures the SRM logic is met and cycling or steady spin arrows are presented to the pilot for up to several seconds. If a spin has been confirmed with no command arrow present, SRM logic may not be fulfilled because of an oscillatory yaw rate and the use of the manual spin recovery switch is required for recovery. If manual spin recovery mode is used, exercise caution during pull-out (use smooth stick inputs) since the flight controls remain in SRM until the airspeed increases above 245 knots or the switch is placed to NORM. While in manual SRM the aircraft is very sensitive to control inputs in all axes until the flight controls revert to CAS. The command arrow indicates the proper control stick position for upright or inverted spin. For upright spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full lateral stick with the spin direction. For inverted spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full lateral stick opposite the spin <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-15-61.<br><br>

With no braking on landing rollout, a planing link failure will normally cause the aircraft to drift into the failed gear as the aircraft decelerates. However, the failure can result in landing gear positions that can range from slightly angled to fully perpendicular to the aircraft. The resulting swerve in the direction of the failure can be severe. Planing link failure indications that are momentary or disappear after initial activation may be indicative of an actual planing link failure.<br>. • A planing link failure may cause a sudden swerve on touchdown in thedirection of the failed gear.<br>. • Planing link failure may not be annunciated until after touchdown andmay provide little to no pilot reaction time between initial annuncia- tion and a violent yaw/swerve. Therefore, if flyaway airspeed is available, pilots should be prepared to make the decision to execute a go around immediately at initial planing link failure annunciation.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-16-6.<br><br>

            . 16.11 FIELD ARRESTMENT.<br><br>. 16.11.1 Field Arresting Gear. Field arresting gear includes anchor chain, water squeezer, and Moresttypes. All require engagement of the arresting hook in a crossdeck pendant cable rigged across the runway. Location of the pendant further identifies the gear type as follows:<br>SHORT FIELD - Located 1,500 to 2,000 feet past approach end of runway. Usually requires request to rig.<br>MIDFIELD - Located near halfway point of runway. Usually requires request to rig for desired direction.<br>ABORT - Located 1,500 to 2,000 feet short of departure end of runway. Usually rigged for immediate use.<br>OVERRUN - Located shortly past departure end of runway. Usually rigged for immediate use.<br>A field may have all, none, or any combination of types. The pilot must know the type, location, and compatibility with your aircraft of the installed gear, and the local policy for rigging installed gear.<br>An engagement in the wrong direction into chain gear severely damages the aircraft.<br>Determine the conditions of an emergency by all means available (instruments, other aircraft, LSO, RDO, tower or other ground personnel). If fuel is streaming, a field arrested landing is not recommended due to the high probability of sparks and heat from the hook igniting the streaming fuel.<br>Determine the best available arresting gear and the type of arrestment. Notify control tower as far in advance as possible and give estimated time to landing in minutes. Unrigged gear probably requires 10 to 20 minutes to rig. If conditions allow, make practice passes to accurately locate arresting gear. Lock shoulder harness.<br>Engage arresting gear on the centerline, in three-point attitude, as slow as practical, and with feet off brakes. After arrestment, common sense and conditions determine whether to keep engines running or to shut down the engines and evacuate the aircraft.<br><br>. 16.11.2 Short Field Arrestment. If there is a directional control problem, an anticipated stopping.<br><br>problem, or a minimum rollout is desired, make a short field arrestment. Request LSO assistance. The LSO should be near the touchdown point with a radio. Inform the LSO of the desired touchdown point.<br>Lower the hook before starting approach and get a positive hook down check. Determine maximum engagement speed at landing gross weight (see figure 16-5). Approach speed depends on the emergency.<br>A constant glide slope approach to touchdown is allowed (mirror or fresnel lens if available). Maintain approach power until arrestment is assured or waveoff is started. Touchdown on centerline at or just before arresting wire. Prepare for waveoff if wire is missed. After engagement, retard throttles to IDLE.<br>Secure engines and evacuate aircraft if required.<br><br>. 16.11.3 Long Field Arrestment. Make a long field arrestment when there is a stopping problem.<br><br>(aborted takeoff, wet or icy runway, loss of brakes, etc.) and it is not possible to go around and make a short field arrestment.

Line up on runway centerline. Tell control tower of your intention to engage arresting gear so that aircraft landing behind you are waved off. Do not delay a decision to go around based solely on the availability of long field gear.<br>After engagement into E-28 or BAK-13 arresting systems, when aircraft speed has been reduced to approximately 20 knots, braking should be applied to stop the forward motion of the aircraft. This prevents an aircraft with idle power from slowly pulling the gear through to a two-block position, and quickly allows the runway to be cleared for other operations. However, in the event of a two-block into any system except E-5, engine thrust should judiciously be applied at the end of the arrestment to minimize aircraft walkback. The aircraft brakes should not be applied during walkback. Some walkback is necessary to clear the deck pendant from the arresting hook; however, the application of excessive power in controlling walkback increases the possibility of deck-pendant hang-up in the arresting hook point.<br><br>. 16.12 FIELD ARRESTMENT GEAR DATA.<br><br>Maximum engaging speeds, gross weights, and off-center distances are shown in the Field Arrestment Gear Data chart, figure 16-5.

            CHAPTER 17.<br><br><br>Ejection.<br><br><br>. 17.1 EJECTION.<br><br>The ejection seat must be used to escape from the aircraft in flight. If the canopy fails to jettison, the seat will eject through the canopy. Analysis of ejections shows:<br>. 1. Optimum speed for ejection is 250 knots and below.. 2. Between 250 and 600 knots, appreciable forces are exerted on the body, making ejection morehazardous.<br>. 3. Above 600 knots, excessive forces are exerted on the body making ejection extremely hazardous.When possible, slow the aircraft before ejection to reduce the forces on the body.<br>Never actuate the manual override handle before ejection. When the handle is actuated, the arm/safe handle is rotated to the safe position, the pilot is released from the seat, and the harness cannot be reconnected. Ejection is impossible and there is no restraint during a forced landing.<br>Whenever possible, ejection airspeed should be limited to a maximum of 400 KCAS when flying with the JHMCS helmet system.<br>The JHMCS configuration can contribute to increased neck loads during ejection, particularly at moderate to high speeds. Generally, neck loads increase as ejection airspeeds increase and may cause severe or fatal injury. Aircrews should eject at the lowest possible airspeed to minimize neck and injury loads.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>Aircrew will brief system peculiarities and potential injury from out of position and high speed ejections prior to each flight when using A/A24A-56 JHMCS lightweight HGU-55 A/P helmet.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-17-1.<br><br>

            If the seat becomes unlocked from the catapult and slides partially up the rails or completely out of the cockpit, ejection and/or chute deployment is still possible but the ejection handle must be pulled, followed by activation of the manual override handle. Under these circumstances low altitude ejection capabilities are compromised.<br>During ejection seat development and testing, the following seats were qualified for the respective minimum and maximum nude weight ranges for aviators listed here: SJU-5/A, 6/A, and SJU-17(V) 1/A, 2/A, and 9/A seats - 136 lb to 213 lb. SJU-17A(V) 1/A, 2/A, and 9/A seats - 136 lb to 245 lb.<br>. • Operation of the ejection seat by personnel weighing less than thequalified minimum nude weight or more than the maximum qualified weight (noted above) subjects the occupant to increased risk of injury.<br>. • Aircrew should be trained in additional ejection risks associated withJHMCS. Ejection with JHMCS may cause severe or fatal injury.<br><br>. 17.1.1 General Injury Risks.<br><br>. 1. Ejection seat stability is directly related to occupant restraint. All occupants should be properlyrestrained in the seat by their torso harness for optimum performance and minimum injury risk.<br>. 2. Inertia reel performance may be degraded for occupants outside of the qualified weight range.Lighter occupants may be injured during retraction, and both light and heavy occupants may experience poor ejection positions, resulting in an increased risk of injury during ejection.<br>An increased risk of severe injury or death during Parachute Landing Fall (PLF) exists with surface winds exceeding 25 knots. High surface winds contribute directly to total landing velocity. When time permits, select parachute steering and turn into the wind to reduce landing velocity.<br><br>. 17.1.2 Injury Risks For Lighter Weight Crewmembers.<br><br>. 1. The ejection seat catapult was designed for the ejection seat qualified weight range.<br>. 2. For SJU-5/A and 6/A seats only:<br><br>a. Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are subject to a higher risk of injury on the ejection seat catapult due to greater accelerations.<br>b. Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are at risk of parachute entanglement at low speeds.<br>. c. Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are at greater risk of injury due to seat instabilitybefore main parachute deployment.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-17-2.<br><br>

Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are subject to a higher risk of injury on the ejection seat catapult due to greater accelerations.<br>b. Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are at risk of injury during ejections near the upper end of mode 1 (approaching 300 knots) due to high parachute opening shock.<br>. c. Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are at greater risk of injury during ejections above300 knots due to instability during drogue deployment.<br><br>. 4. For SJU-17A(V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A seats only:<br><br>a. Occupants weighing less than 100 pounds are subject to a higher risk of injury on the ejection seat catapult due to greater accelerations.<br>b.

Occupants weighing less than 136 pounds are at greater risk of injury during ejections above300 knots due to seat instability during drogue deployment.<br>Lighter weight aircrew have greater risk of neck injury during ejection while using the JHMCS configuration. Minimum nude aircrew weights authorized to fly with the JHMCS helmet system is 136 pounds. Aircrew weighing less than the authorized minimum nude weight are restricted from flying with the JHMCS helmet system.<br><br>. 17.1.3 Injury Risks For Heavier Weight Crewmembers.<br><br>. 1. For SJU-5/A and 6/A and SJU-17(V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A seats only:a. Occupants weighing more than 213 pounds may not attain sufficient altitude for parachute full inflation in Zero-Zero cases or at extremely low altitudes and velocities.<br>b. Occupants weighing more than 213 pounds are at a greater risk of injury during parachute landing due to high descent rates.<br>. c. Occupants weighing more than 213 pounds may not attain sufficient altitude to clear theaircraft tail structure.<br><br>. 2. For SJU-17A(V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A seats only:<br><br>a. Occupants weighing more than 245 pounds may not attain sufficient altitude for parachute full inflation in Zero-Zero cases or at extremely low altitudes and velocities.<br>b. Occupants weighing more than 245 pounds are at a greater risk of injury during parachute landing due to high descent rates.<br>. c. Occupants weighing more than 245 pounds may not attain sufficient altitude to clear theaircraft tail structure.<br><br>. 17.1.4 Low Altitude Ejection. Low altitude ejection decisions must be based on the minimum speed,.<br><br>minimum altitude and sink rate limitations of the ejection system. Figure 17-1 shows minimum ejection altitude for a given sink rate. Figure 17-2 shows minimum ejection altitude for a given airspeed, dive angle and bank angle. Ejection seat trajectory is improved if the aircraft is zoomed. The additional altitude increases time available for seat separation and parachute deployment. Do not delay ejection if the aircraft is nose down and cannot be leveled.<br>With wings level and no sink rate, ejection is feasible within the following parameters:<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALV-17-3.<br><br>

            . 1. Ground level - zero airspeedSafe ejection with SJU-5/A and 6/A seats may not be possible in a zero-zero condition if there is a tailwind component on the aircraft.<br>. 2. Ground to 50,000 feet - 600 knots maximum.Ejection at low altitude allows only a matter of seconds to prepare for landing. Over water, inflation of the LPU is the most important step to be accomplished. Release of the parachute quick-release fittings as the feet contact the water is the second most important step to prevent entanglement in the parachute shroud lines.<br>When ejection is in the immediate vicinity of the carrier, parachute entanglement combined with wake and associated turbulence can rapidly pull a survivor under. The deployed seat survival kit may contribute to shroud line entanglement. The survivor must be prepared to cut shroud lines that are dragging him down.<br>The crashed aircraft may release large quantities of jet fuel and fumes which could hamper breathing and create a fire hazard if smoke or flare marker is present. The emergency oxygen system may be invaluable in this case and discarding the survival kit would terminate its use. However, totally discarding the survival kit may be appropriate after considering weather, sea conditions, and rescue potential.<br>The variety and complexity of conditions encountered during the time critical actions following a low altitude overwater ejection make it impossible to formulate procedures to cover every contingency.<br>Safe ejection with SJU-5/A and 6/A seats may not be possible in a zero-zero condition if there is a tailwind component on the aircraft.<br><br>. 17.1.5 High Altitude Ejection. The basic low altitude procedure is applicable to high altitude.<br><br>ejection. The zoom is useful to slow the aircraft to a safer ejection speed or to provide more time and glide distance if immediate ejection is not necessary. If the aircraft is descending out of control, eject by 6,000 feet AGL. Even if under control, do not delay ejection below 2,000 feet AGL. Head the aircraft toward an unpopulated area, if possible.<br>Low altitude ejection may result in parachute canopy disintegration due to the aircraft impact fireball.<br><br>. 17.1.6 Ejection Procedures.

            CHAPTER 19.<br><br><br>Instrument Flight.<br><br><br>. 19.1 INSTRUMENT FLIGHT.<br><br><br>. 19.1.1 Before Takeoff. Thoroughly check flight instruments (primary and standby) and navigation.<br><br>equipment before takeoff. Cycle HUD attitude switch to STBY (note standby attitude reference display) and back to AUTO.<br>If icing conditions may be encountered, perform engine anti-ice detector test. If a climb through icing conditions is anticipated, place engine anti-ice and pitot switches ON.<br><br>. 19.1.2 In Flight. Frequently crosscheck primary and standby instruments. A slowly flashing velocity.<br><br>vector indicates the INS is still providing valid attitude information from the Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) mode, but ADC is now the data source for the velocity vector.<br><br>. 19.1.3 Approaches.<br><br><br>. 19.1.3.1 Descent. Enroute descent should be flown at 250 knots, idle power.<br><br><br>. 19.1.3.2 Holding. Fly the holding pattern as directed/depicted and maintain 220 to 240 knots for.<br><br>maximum endurance at 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Total fuel flow is approximately 3,600 pph (60 pounds/minute).<br>. 19.1.3.3 Non-Precision. The navigation aids available provide excellent position keeping capability,multiple redundancy and steering cues. INS offset data can be used to provide accurate steering to a tacan IAF and the course select option can be used to obtain a visual reference on the HSI and steering cues on the HUD.<br>Penetration should be flown at 250 knots, 75% RPM and speedbrake as required. Dirty up at 10 nm from touch down. Plan for 800 pounds of fuel required to fly from the IAF to landing for a typical CV tacan approach from 20,000 feet. Use of HALF flaps reduces fuel flow and increases approach speed 7 to 9 knots.<br><br>. 19.1.3.4 Precision. The downwind leg should be flown at 230 to 250 knots with gear UP and flaps.<br><br>AUTO. Transition to the landing configuration when directed or no later than 6 nm from touch down.<br>To begin descent, lower the velocity vector to approximately -3° and maintain ON-SPEED AOA. Small changes in velocity vector placement can be used to control glidepath. Set radar altimeter at decision height and be prepared for missed approach.<br><br>. 19.2 DEGRADED SYSTEMS.<br><br>If the INS built-in test detects a malfunction in the INS processor that prevents inertial navigation, the ASN-130 INS automatically reverts to the AHRS mode which provides unfiltered attitude data <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVI-19-1.<br><br>

            to the mission computer. The AHRS mode can also be selected by placing the INS switch to GYRO.<br>. • When operating in AHRS mode at night or in IMC, avoid unnecessaryhigh-G maneuvering flight. AHRS attitude should be frequently crosschecked with the standby attitude indicator, altimeter and mag- netic compass.<br>. • In the NAV mode, no indication of a slowly degrading INS is providedto the pilot other than increasing velocity errors. If there is an abnormally high velocity change, INS derived attitude should be carefully monitored.<br>If the INS built-in-test detects a malfunction in the INS processor that prevents inertial navigation, the ASN-139 INS and EGI INS automatically revert to standby attitude reference indicator.

            CHAPTER 20.<br><br><br>Extreme Weather Procedures.<br><br><br>. 20.1 ICE AND RAIN.<br><br>In freezing conditions, water draining from beneath the left engine inlet can be drawn into the intake and freeze creating a potential ice FOD danger. This situation is most likely at temperatures near freezing with a dew point temp/freezing temp spread of less than 8°.<br>Before flight, check with the weather service for freezing level and probable icing areas. Flight through known or suspected icing conditions should be avoided, if possible, to prevent engine FOD from ice ingestion.<br>Prolonged flight in icing conditions is an emergency situation. Flight duration which allows a noticeable accumulation of ice (more than 3/8 inch) on the wing leading edge flaps constitutes prolonged flight. Ice will rapidly form on the inlet lip and, if allowed to accumulate, can be drawn into the engine causing compressor stall and major FOD. Severe icing conditions can result in rapid ice accumulation in a very short time. More than 1/2 inch of ice can form on the inlet lip in 8 minutes in light to moderate icing conditions. Ice from the inlet lip has been ingested by the engine while at 92% rpm and in a steady state 24° bank resulting in compressor stall. At lower power settings, similar inlet ice has shed harmlessly overboard. An INLET ICE caution should serve as a warning to take immediate action to avoid further ice accumulation.<br>If icing is anticipated - . 1.

            CHAPTER 23.<br><br><br>Communication-Identification.<br><br><br>Equipment.<br><br><br>. 23.1 INTERCOM SYSTEM.<br><br>The intercom system (ICS) provides amplification and distribution of all voice communications, voice alerts and tones originating within the ICS and advisory tones originating external to the ICS.<br>Intercommunications between the pilot and ground crew are also provided by the intercom system via an external panel on the right side of the aircraft. A volume control on the external panel is provided for adjusting audio volume to the ground crew headset.<br><br>. 23.1.1 Volume Control Before AFC 268. Six volume controls are provided to control pilot headset.<br><br>volume for (1) TACAN ident, (2) transmit sidetone/aircrew intercom audio/ground crew intercom audio, (3) RWR audio, (4) WPN delivery audio, (5) AUX 2 (formally ECM audio), and (6) auxiliary audio (available for other uses). Additional functions performed by the ICS are (1) control of comm 1 and comm 2 plain/cipher text mode, (2) comm 1, comm 2 guard channel transmit, (3) control/zeroize of IFF crypto code, (4) IFF Mode 4 control (visual and audible indications of interrogations) and, (5) IFF master switch for normal/emergency operation.<br><br>. 23.1.2 Volume Control After AFC 268. Eight volume controls are provided to control pilot headset.<br><br>volume for (1) voice activated intercom (VOX), (2) transmit sidetone/aircrew intercom audio/ground crew intercom audio, (3) MIDS A audio, (4) MIDS B audio, (5) RWR audio, (6) WPN delivery audio, . (7) TACAN ident, and (8) auxiliary audio (available for other uses).<br>. 23.2 VHF/UHF AND MIDS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.<br><br>The aircraft has two voice communication radios which can be either two ARC-182, two ARC- 210(RT-1556), one of each, or one ARC-210(RT-1556) and F/A-18C/D AFTER AFC 269 one ARC 210 DCS (Digital Communication System). The ARC 210 DCS is only installed as a comm 2 radio. The VHF/UHF radios, comm 1 and comm 2, provide air-to-air/air-to-ground voice communications, and in conjunction with Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) equipment, provide a DF function. The radios can be operated in a plain mode, an anti-jam (Have Quick) mode (ARC 210), a secure mode (KY-58 or DCS), and a relay mode, in either normal or secure voice. An additional function is generation of a 1,020 hz tone by either comm 1 or comm 2 that serves as an ident tone for weapon release. With AFC 270, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) is installed. MIDS, a joint service system, provides secure, jam resistant voice and data communications utilizing spread spectrum, frequency-hopping, and error detection/correction techniques. In addition, MIDS provides the functionality of the AN/ARN-118 TACAN.<br>The comm 1 and comm 2 radios operate in fixed frequency plain, fixed frequency/secure, Electronic Counter-Countermeasure (ECCM), or ECCM/secure mode. Comm 1 and comm 2 radios operate in the frequency bands listed below and, when enabled, integral guard receivers continuously monitor the <br>emergency guard channels for each frequency band:<br><br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-23-1.<br><br>

Twenty channels in the 30 to 400 MHz band may be pre-set to assigned frequencies as a convenience in the rapid selection of operating frequencies.<br>When the Guard receiver (GRCV) is enabled, comm 1 or comm 2 is able to continuously monitor the <br>. 243.0 MHz AM Guard frequency while the radio is operating in the UHF band. When the radio is tuned.<br><br>in the VHF band, 121.5 MHz is monitored.<br>The ECCM modes are Have Quick (HQ) I, II, and Single Channel Ground/Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS). HQ I, an anti-jam (AJ) voice communication system, uses a single Word of Day (WOD) and operates in UHF AM mode using frequency hopping techniques. HQ II is an extension of HQ I operation that has multiple WODs and the capacity to store six multiple WODs. SINCGARS is also a jam-resistant voice communication system that operates in VHF FM mode.<br>Secure voice operation is accomplished using the KY-58 system or DCS. With the ARC-210 (RT-1556) during secure operation, the radio provides a Baseband/Diphase (BB/DP) control signal to the KY-58 to switch from BB to DP or vice versa. Diphase is the encrypted audio for the VHF/UHF FM mode. With the ARC 210 DCS a secure voice capability is integral and does not require a KY-58 speech encoder.<br>Comm 1 and comm 2 may be operated in a relay mode, in either normal (plain), secure (cipher), or ECCM operation. In this mode, the voice signal received by one communication set is retransmitted by the other communication set on a different, pre-assigned frequency, provided the two frequencies are spaced a minimum of 10 MHz apart. Cipher relay in Diphase mode is performed if and only if the Diphase option has been enabled for comm 1 or comm 2.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-23-2.<br><br>

This tunes the radio to the preset manual frequency. Using M channel allows the operator to change the communication frequency without disturbing the twenty fixed frequency presets. The C position tunes the radio to the preset Cue frequency in SINCGARS (SG) operation. The S position selects the maritime mode which tunes the radio to the selected maritime channel.<br>When the active comm is in the AJ mode, by rotating the comm 1 channel selector knob, the operator may select one of 20 Have Quick or SINCGARS preset channels, Manual Data Fill Mode (M), or Cue channel (C).<br>In ECCM mode, the position 1, 2, ..., or 20 selects the preset mode. These preset channels can be either a HQ I, II or SINCGARS presets. The radio operates on the Word Of Day, multiple WODs, or net number stored in the selected preset channel. The M position in AJ operation selects the Manual Data Fill Mode. This allows the operator to verify WOD for a particular day, manually load HQ WODs, or clear all stored net data. The C position channel operates just as the Cue channel in normal mode.<br>All modes listed above are arranged and described in three main operations: (1) normal and plain operation, (2) Have Quick, and (3) SINCGARS operation. Normal operation uses the twenty presets or the manual select channel in fixed frequency operation. Also available are the Guard and maritime channels. In Have Quick operation, the procedures for using (1) preset mode, (2) HQ Time options, and . (3) manual data fill mode, are described. Similar to Have Quick, the SINCGARS operation includes (1)preset mode, (2) using SG Time options, (3) performing Electronic Remote Fill with ERF option, (4) data fill using Cold Start option, and (5) Cue channel selection.<br>The comm 2 channel selector knob performs the same functions as the comm 1 channel selector knob except that it controls the operation of the comm 2 receiver-transmitter.<br><br>. 23.2.1.1.3 Comm 1 and Comm 2 Channel Display Windows. These windows display the preset.<br><br>channel (1 thru 20), guard channel selection (G), manual position (M), and with ARC-210 cue (C) or maritime (S) as selected by the comm 1 or comm 2 channel selector knobs. In AJ mode, these windows display 1 thru 20 for the indication of HQ or SG preset channel number, M for manual data fill mode selection, or C for cue channel. In MIDS equipped aircraft the comm channel display window visually identifies which audio sources are currently active. An inverted triangle indicates comm 1 or comm 2 is transmitting or receiving. An upright triangle indicates MIDS A or MIDS B is transmitting or receiving. An hourglass symbol indicated simultaneous comm and MIDS radio operation. The triangle/hourglass symbols remain as long as the audio source is transmitting or receiving.

            . 23.3 SECURE SPEECH SYSTEM (KY-58).<br><br>The secure speech system is used for ciphering (coding) or deciphering (decoding) audio routed through the COMM 1 and COMM 2 receiver-transmitters. The system consists primarily of the KY-58 control panel assembly on the right console. Controls and indicators are on the KY-58 control panel assembly and on the communication control panel on the left console.<br><br>. 23.3.1 KY-58 Control Panel Assembly. The control panel assembly functions as a ciphering or.<br><br>deciphering device for secure speech operation.<br><br>. 23.3.1.1 Ciphered Transmission. During ciphered transmissions, audio from the microphone is.<br><br>routed through the communication control panel to the KY-58 control panel assembly where it is enciphered. The enciphered audio is routed back to the communication control panel and then to COMM 1 or COMM 2 receiver-transmitter for transmission.<br><br>. 23.3.1.2 Ciphered Reception. During reception of ciphered information, the ciphered audio is.<br><br>routed from the COMM 1 or COMM 2 receiver-transmitter to the communication control panel and then to the control panel assembly for deciphering. The deciphered audio is routed to the communi- cation control panel and to the headset.<br><br>. 23.3.1.3 Ciphered Relay Mode. During ciphered relay mode of operation, ciphered information.<br><br>received on one radio is routed from the radio, through the communication control panel to the second radio for transmission. The ciphered information received on the first radio is also routed through the communication control panel to the KY-58 control panel assembly for deciphering. The deciphered audio is routed through the communication control panel to the headset. This enables the crewmember to hear deciphered relayed audio when in the ciphered relay mode. When cipher is selected on the communication control panel immediately after operating in a relay plain, COMM 1 plain, or COMM 2 plain mode of operation, the crewmember must press the transmit key for either COMM 1 or COMM 2 two times to enable ciphered relay operations. When the relay aircraft is operating both radios within the same bandwidth, the two frequency selections must be separated by a minimum of 10 MHz.<br><br>. 23.3.2 Controls and Indicators. The only cipher control on the communication control panel is the.<br><br>RLY CIPHER/PLAIN switch (relay switch). The controls on the KY-58 control panel assembly are the MODE select knob, the unlabled fill select knob, the VOLUME control knob, and the unlabled power select knob (see figure 23-3).<br><br>Figure 23-3.

            CHAPTER 24.<br><br><br>Navigation Equipment.<br><br>Navigation equipment consists of the following: Inertial Navigation System (INS, AN/ASN-130A/ . 139), Global Positioning System (GPS, AN/ASN 163) or Embedded INS/GPS (EGI), TACAN (RT1159A/ARN-118), Instrument Landing System (ILS, AN/ARA-63), and Data Link (D/L, RT/1379A/ ASW). Even though the ADF is part of the communication system, it has application in the navigation system and a brief description is provided.<br><br>. 24.1 NAVIGATION CONTROLS AND INDICATORS.<br><br>Navigation controls and indicators consist of the UFC, HI/MPCD, DDI, HUD, INS mode switch, course set switch, and communication control panel. These controls and indicators are integrated in the navigation system. HI/MPCD and HUD symbology, and UFC functions are described in Chapter 2.<br><br>. 24.1.1 UFC. The UFC allows: ON/OFF operation of the ILS, TACAN, D/L, and ADF; data entry for.<br><br>the TACAN, GPS, and INS; and mode selection for the D/L.<br><br>. 24.1.2 Moving Map - Digital Map Set (DMS) (163985 AND UP). (Before AFC 327) The DMS utilizes.<br><br>the MPCD to provide the pilot/ WSO with a high resolution color map display for day/night navigation. The DMS display can be selected on the front or rear MPCDs; however, the DDIs display only a monochrome image.<br>(After AFC 327) The DMS is displayed in color and can be displayed on any DDI and the front and rear MPCD.<br><br>. 24.1.2.1 Map Option. The MAP option provides On/Off control of the DMS map when selected from.<br><br>an MPCD (MAP option is boxed when the map is ON). When MAP is selected from a DDI, the HSI format source alternates between stroke (DDI symbol generator) and raster (DMS mono-map) on all DDIs displaying the HSI format. The DMS map is commanded ON when the raster HSI is selected on a DDI or MPCD.<br>When Map Update is selected from the forward cockpit, the TDC is assigned to the Map Slew function. When Map Update is selected from the aft MPCD, the LDC is assigned to the Map Slew function (if the LDDI is not communicating on the AVMUX, the RDC will be assigned). When Map Update is selected from the Right or Left DDI, the RDC or LDC, respectively, is assigned to the Map Slew function. When Map Update is selected, MAP is automatically boxed. When Map Update is selected on a DDI, all DDIs displaying the HSI format are driven by the DMS mono-map.<br><br>. 24.1.2.1.1 DMS Map Range Scales. For HSI in T UP (Track Up) or N UP (True North Up), valid.<br><br>Range Scale/Map Type combinations are as follows: 40/1:2M, 20/1:2M-ZOOM, 10/1:500K, 5/1:250K.<br>For HSI in DCTR (Decenter) valid Range Scale/Map Type combinations are as follows: 80/1:2M, <br>40/1:2M-ZOOM, 20/1:500K, 10/1:250K.<br><br><br>Map compatible range scales are:<br><br>. 1.

The HI/MPCD also allows selection of various TACAN, ILS, INS, and D/L functions using the HI/MPCD option pushbuttons. See figure 24-1.<br>The forward and aft MPCDs are driven by a color output from the DMS when displaying the HSI format. The HSI format displayed on the DDI/MPCD is driven by either a mono-map output from the DMS or a DDI symbol generator. The DMS mono-map output contains the same information as the DMS color output (except for color), including cautions if they are provided with the color output. If the DMS fails, the MC commands the DDI to drive both MPCDs (forward and aft MPCDs are repeaters), and allows selection of all F/A-18 formats.<br>Navigation symbols and digital readouts are normally displayed on the MPCD. One of three TDC assignment symbols can be displayed in the upper right corner of a TDC compatible display, to indicate a TDC is assigned to the display in the front cockpit only, rear cockpit only, or both cockpits (respectively). When a TDC is assigned to the map slew function, SLEW is displayed in the upper right corner of the HSI display along with one of three arrows to indicate TDC assignment to the display in the front only, rear only, or both cockpits (respectively). See figure 24-1 <br>. 24.1.3.1 HSI Option (After AFC 327). This option returns the operator to the Top Level HSI display.<br><br>after the DMS has been configured for operation. The HSI option coincides with the other HSI options found on similar HSI displays to ensure consistency between displays. See figure 24-2.<br><br>. 24.1.3.2 MODE Option (Aircraft 163985 AND UP). The HSI display MODE option is located.<br><br>adjacent to the center left pushbutton of the DDI or MPCD. Before AFC 327, selecting the MODE option enables T UP (Track-up), N UP (true north up), DCTR (decenter), MAP, and slew options to be displayed on the left side of the HSI display. After AFC 327, selecting the MODE option enables T UP (Track-up), CHRT (chart), DCTR (decenter), and slew options to be displayed on the left side of the HSI display. At aircraft power-up/WonW, the system initializes to: Map boxed (On), Centered, T UP, and 40 nm scale. See figure 24-1.<br><br>. 24.1.3.3 MODE Backup (Aircraft 163985 AND UP). If aircraft magnetic heading or aircraft.<br><br>horizontal velocities become invalid, the HSI format is limited to a Centered North-up mode. The T UP and DCTR legends are removed and their selection inhibited from the HSI Mode sublevel. The N UP legend on the HSI Mode sublevel is boxed under this condition. When aircraft magnetic heading and aircraft horizontal velocities become valid, the HSI format is driven to the currently selected mode and the T UP, N UP and DCTR legends are provided and processed on the HSI Mode sublevel.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>The currently selected HSI format mode option remains unchanged when the aircraft magnetic heading or aircraft horizontal velocities become invalid.<br><br>. 24.1.3.3.1 MAP Modes/Data Products. After AFC 327, each of the map modes (CHRT, DTED, and.<br><br>CIB) provides a different plan-view map/image. The actual presentation and availability of the different maps/images are independent and mutually exclusive. Only one map mode can be selected at any one time. The detailed images and associated area coverage for each mode are dependent on the map (theater) data loaded in the DMS or installed on the mission card. Each plan-view map, regardless of mode, presents an image that can support moving map capability and/or slew mode functions. When toggling through the different modes, different map images are available providing the mode specific <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-2.<br><br>

The INS detects aircraft motion and provides acceleration, velocity, present position, pitch, roll, and true heading to related systems.<br>Correction signals from accelerometers provide constant leveling. In GPS capable aircraft the INS is coupled to the GPS (in AINS mode) to provide a more accurate aided source of position and velocity.<br>The INS uses both periodic and initiated built-in test (BIT). The periodic BIT monitors essential parameters within the system and provides inflight, shipboard, and ground failure detection and isolation. Initiated BIT is performed on the ground and accomplishes that portion of the failure detection and isolation capability which periodic BIT is unable to do. The INS system provides automatic (AN/ASN-130A, manual for AN/ASN-139) INS degrading to an attitude heading reference system (AHRS) when INS BIT detects a significant fault in the inertial processor. An indication of automatic switching to AHRS is a flashing velocity vector on the HUD, a POS/ADC caution on the DDI and a master caution, provided that the INS is the position keeping source. Operating in AHRS mode, unfiltered INS attitude data is displayed to the pilot.

GPS is only authorized as an aid to visual navigation (VFR) and situational awareness (SA). GPS may not be used as a primary or supplemental navigation source to file or fly in the National Air Space (NAS).<br>The GPS consists of an aircraft mounted receiver/processor which receives modulated signals from twenty-four high orbit satellites through the GPS antenna. The satellite data is used to determine aircraft position and velocity. The GPS can be initialized with crypto keys, enabling encrypted P-code (precise) navigation signals to be received. GPS has four modes of operation. In NOT READY mode the system is off. With Initialize mode (INIT) the power supply is turned on, almanac data and waypoint data are loaded into the MC. In addition, Cryptokey loading may be performed via a KYK-13. In NAV mode, the GPS tracks the best four satellite constellations possible to provide the most accurate PVT solution. TEST mode is provided for maintenance and inflight testing.<br><br>. 24.2.1.3.1 Mixed Mode Satellite Selection (MC OFP 15C AND UP).

There are three types of INS alignment modes that can be selected via.<br><br>the INS Mode Selector Knob: CV (carrier alignment), GND (ground alignment), and IFA (radar inflight or GPS alignment).<br><br>. 24.2.3.1 CV Alignment Mode. Selecting CV alignment provides three types of CV alignment.<br><br>options: RF (radio frequency), CBL (cable), and MAN (manual). With the RF and CBL alignment options the aircraft is data linked to the SINS (ships inertial navigation system). However, with the MAN option there is no data link capability and alignment data must be entered manually.<br><br>. 24.2.3.1.1 RF/CBL (SINS) Alignment. With the RF/CBL (SINS) alignment, the aircraft’s INS.<br><br>automatically compensates for the difference between the aircraft deck position and the SINS position.<br>To perform this alignment, the parking brake must be set, and the INS mode selector knob must be switched to CV. When this is done the INS and data link are turned on, and the CV align display appears on the HSI display and UFC. At this point in time, the TIME display on the CV align display begins to increment. When proceeding with an RF alignment, information is received via radio frequency and RF is displayed to the right of CV on the CV align display. Also, the alignment frequency is displayed on the UFC scratchpad, which may be changed using the UFC keypad. When a cable is connected to the aircraft, information is received via the cable and CBL is displayed to the right of CV on the CV align display. RF/CBL flashes until SINS data becomes valid. During the first 1 to 2 minutes of alignment, the INS platform is being leveled (AN/ASN-130A), and NO ATT is displayed to the right of QUAL: on the CV align display.

When MAN is selected MAN is boxed and the STD HDG option is removed, the manual align display allows entry of carrier lat/long data, heading (CV HDG) and speed (CV SPD). The INS uses this data to update present position during the alignment. See figure 24-3.<br>During the alignment NO ATT is displayed on the CV align display until the INS platform is leveled, then a QUAL (quality) number is displayed. The AC (alignment counter) number on the INS maintenance align 1 display on the DDI should also be monitored during alignment. To select INS align 1 display, press the BIT pushbutton on the DDI menu display, then press the MAINT pushbutton on the maintenance BIT display. As the alignment progresses the qual number on the HSI decreases and the AC number on the DDI increases. When a satisfactory alignment is achieved, OK is displayed next to the QUAL number. The INS can then be switched to the NAV mode. If it is not switched, it automatically reverts to the NAV mode when weight is off the wheels. If during manual alignment the carrier heading changes more than 10° and/or carrier speed varies more than 1 knot, and the AC number on the DDI is 3 or less, the pilot must enter the new data to reinitialize the alignment.<br>This usually results in the QUAL number starting over at 99.9, however, it will rapidly align back to the QUAL number it had prior to the update and the continuation of the alignment will be faster than if the update had not been made. When AC=4 is displayed on the DDI the INS tracks CV heading and speed changes and the INS does not need to be reinitialized. The parking brake must remain set until alignment is complete. If the parking brake is released before OK is displayed, and the align quality is greater than 5 the system sequences into AHRS (GYRO) mode. If the action occurs with the align quality less than 5, the system goes to a limited performance navigation mode or complete reinitialization is required to complete the normal alignment, see figure 24-3.

When stored heading alignment is entered, the alignment progresses the same as a normal ground alignment.<br><br>. 24.2.3.3 Incomplete Alignment Advisory (MC OFP 13C AND UP). An incomplete alignment.<br><br>advisory ALGN is displayed when the INS is manually switched to NAV without a complete alignment.<br><br>. 24.2.3.3.1 IFA (Inflight Alignment) Mode. There are several types of IFA: a complete IFA, a.<br><br>CV/GND alignment completion, or a gyro recovery. Aircraft equipped with GPS can perform an inflight alignment using GPS position and velocity. A complete IFA may be performed when the INS experiences a total shutdown. An IFA may be performed to complete a partial CV/GND alignment. A gyro recovery may be performed when the INS completely shuts down, and radar or ADC data is not available for a complete IFA, see figure 24-5.<br><br>. 24.2.3.4 Inflight Alignment. A complete IFA may be initiated after a total INS shutdown. During.<br><br>IFA, the ADC must be available to provide magnetic heading information, and the radar must be capable of providing continuous precision velocity update (CONT PVU) information. Once the INS has shutdown, place the ATT/ATTD switch to STBY to verify the accuracy of HUD attitude data by crosschecking the standby instruments. Select NAV master mode and radar altitude to HUD. Then place the INS knob to OFF for 5 seconds for the AN/ASN-139 and EGI (AN/ASN-130A requires 3 minutes). If MSP codes 02F or 061 are present, the INS knob should remain in OFF, and select <br>POS/TACAN.<br><br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. • MSP codes 02F or 061 indicate that NAV data is frozen and the NAVdata provided to the HUD is not reliable.

If A/C data is incorrect, refer to A/C Programming (this chapter), to enter correct aircraft data. Fly straight and level unaccelerated flight for 20 seconds, then place the INS knob to IFA (INS has been off for 5 seconds for the AN/ASN-139 and EGI or 3 minutes for AN/ASN-130A) and maintain straight and level unaccelerated flight for at least 30 seconds. Then fly straight and level as much as practical.<br>When IFA has been selected, the radar may be commanded to the PVU mode and the alignment display appears on the HI/MPCD, see figure 24-5.

During the first 10 to 25 seconds (AN/ASN-139 and EGI) or 1 to 2 minutes (AN/ASN-130A) of the alignment while the INS platform is being leveled, NO ATT is displayed to the right of QUAL on the Inflight Align display. Wait for 30 seconds of align time for the platform to level, then place the ATT/ATTD switch to AUTO or INS. NO ATT is then replaced with a quality number (which is an estimate of present position accuracy) and the INS ATT caution clears.

Fly straight and level for as.<br><br>much as practical during alignment. If a turn must be made during IFA, make the turn quickly (exceeding 30° of bank) and return to straight and level flight as soon as practical. This prevents the INS from aligning to a false reference by placing the alignment on hold until straight and level flight is regained. During IFA, air data dead reckoning is used for navigation and to maintain a current present position. If GPS is acquired, finish the INS alignment with GPS IFA as described above.<br>When the inflight align displays an OK after the QUAL number, place the INS knob to the NAV position.<br>The PVU mode may be overridden by deselecting the CONT PVU option; however, IFA quality will be affected. Deselecting CONT PVU commands PVU for 10 seconds of each minute alternating with the last selected radar mode. When air-to-ground ranging (AGR) mode is selected (for instance, via HUD designation), CONT PVU is deselected, 20 seconds of AGR is commanded, then PVU is commanded for 10 seconds of each minute alternating with AGR. In PVU mode, the radar provides Doppler velocities for the INS alignment. The radar look-down velocities angles are optimized for land or sea return by selection of the LAND or SEA options at the bottom of the display. PVU is inhibited for IFA if the aircraft is not in the NAV master mode. If the radar is not operating or if it is inhibited from operating in PVU, the time-in-alignment display flashes and the CONT PVU is not displayed since continuous PVU cannot be commanded.

Aircraft with GPS can utilize the GPS to store up to 200.<br><br>waypoints. GPS points are loaded into the GPS from the MU or MDL. GPS points can be displayed and/or transferred into the MC waypoint data base via the HSI/DATA/GPS display. With MC OFP 12A, the GPS LOAD option, available on the GPS display, commands the MC to load the GPS Almanac Data file, Point data, and Point ID files from the MDL.<br>A GPS point can be transferred into any MC waypoint by pressing the XFER option on the GPS point data display. When GPS option is selected the first 24 GPS points are displayed in alphanumeric order. Selection of points to load is accomplished via the right and down arrows and page selection arrows. Repeated selection of these arrows causes the cursor to wrap around. It may take as long as three seconds to retrieve selected position data and display it on the GPS point data display. See figure 24-8. To transfer GPS waypoints to the MC, select the desired waypoint number with the up/down arrows on the HSI/DATA/GPS sublevel, then move the cursor down/right and/or page up/down to the desired waypoint ID code, and press XFER. At this time the GPS LAT/LONG, GPS altitude, and current ID code displays are blanked and the XFER option is removed. The selected ID code is displayed in the ‘‘Current ID’’ position indicating that waypoint is requested. After approximately 3 seconds, the requested GPS LAT/LONG and GPS altitude is displayed and the XFER option is returned for transfer selection. If a GPS ID code is requested and is not available, the selected ID code is displayed with a line through it. Once a GPS waypoint has been transferred from the GPS to the MC it becomes an MC waypoint. The waypoint ID code is retained and is displayed on the top level HSI and HSI/DATA/WYPT formats when the waypoint is selected as the current waypoint.<br><br>. 24.2.5.1.2 UTM WYPT Data Entry. Data for all waypoints and OAPs may be entered as universal.<br><br>transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates. See figure 24-9, sheet 2. UTM Grid Coordinates are defined by a Spheroid or DATUM, Grid Zone Designation, Square Identification, and Easting/Northing. Grid zone designation divides the world area between N84° and S80° into 100 km squares. At power up with WOW the MC initializes waypoint elevation, O/S range and elevation, and TACAN elevation in FEET, and O/S bearing to TRUE. With MC OFP 12A, 13C AND UP, the PRECISE option on the DATA display allows the pilot to select either 100 meter or 1 meter accuracy.

Then, select the A/C option to bring up the A/C data sublevel display. This display shows the current position keeping source, present position (lat-long) of the aircraft, current windspeed and direction, magnetic variation, and magnetic/true heading selection. Aircraft data is entered through the UFC keypad. See figure 24-9.<br>BEFORE MC OFP 20X, lat/long is entered as Degrees/Minutes/Thousandths of minutes (LATLN DCML), or Degrees/Minutes/Seconds (LATLN SEC). With MC OFP 20X AND UP and PRECISE unboxed, lat-long is entered either as Degrees/Minutes/ Hundredths of minutes (LATLN DCML) or Degrees/Minutes/Seconds (LATLN SEC). With MC OFP 20X AND UP and PRECISE boxed, lat-long is entered either as Degrees/Minutes/Ten Thousandths of minutes (LATLN DCML) or Degrees/ Minutes/Seconds/Hundredths of seconds (LATLN SEC). Actuating the LATLN XXXX option toggles between the selection of LATLN DCML and LATLN SEC. The selected LATLN format is reflected on all displays and UFC formats throughout the cockpit. After MC OFP 20X non-PRECISE DCML is the cold start default. If EGI or GPS is installed and the aircraft is tracking satellites the GPS estimated vertical error (GPS VERR), estimated horizontal error (GPS HERR) and time (GPS TIME) are displayed.

On the UFC select: the WSPD pushbutton to enter wind speed data, the WDIR pushbutton to enter wind direction, and MVAR to enter magnetic variation.<br><br>. 24.2.5.7 True/Magnetic Heading Selection. Heading indications that appear in the HUD and HSI.<br><br>display can be referenced to either true north or magnetic north. The capability to select a true north heading is useful in extreme northern operations. With true north heading selected, the HSI display, A/A and A/G radar displays, Link 4 display, and the HUD are all referenced to true north. The true north indication on the HUD is a T displayed below the current heading. True north indications on the HSI display consist of TRUE being displayed below the current heading readout and a T being displayed below the lubber line. The true heading indications on the HSI display also appear on the Link 4 display. No indications of true north selection appear on the A/A or A/G radar display. Since aircraft magnetic variation is used as the best available magnetic variation source, the heading reference should not be changed when navigating a selected course. With true heading selected, TACAN symbology is also referenced to true north if the TACAN station is in the TACAN data table.<br>If the TACAN station is not in the TACAN data table, magnetic is used. There is no indication when magnetic heading is selected. When INS true heading becomes invalid, magnetic heading is used. If MC1 fails, heading selection is not available. At power up with WOW the system initializes with magnetic heading selected. To select the desired reference heading, first select DATA in the HSI display.

For F/A-18A/B aircraft an MC internal counter is used to keep.<br><br>Zulu time. Therefore, ZTOD must be set to initialize the MC internal counter. Also, ZTOD must be set in order for ZTOD to be displayed on the HUD and HI/MPCD, and before the MC is able to calculate MC required groundspeed and TOT. In other words ZTOD must be set every time following aircraft power up.<br>For F/A-18C/D aircraft the FIRAMS Real Time Clock (RTC) is used to keep ZTOD. Therefore, the only time ZTOD would need to be set is if the FIRAMS RTC failed power up BIT.

The update option is not available in AINS position keeping.<br>On F/A-18A after AFC 253 or 292 and F/A-18 C/D aircraft, after an update is performed, the CANCEL option is displayed on the HSI UPDATE option display. Pressing the CANCEL option cancels the previous update and removes the CANCEL option. The INS then updates the aircraft position using the last accepted position update. The CANCEL option is also removed upon touchdown or when present position is changed using the UFC.<br><br>. 24.2.7.1 Designation (DSG) Update. To perform a designation update press the UPDT option on the.<br><br>HSI display. Select the DSG option on the UPDT sublevel display. Designate a waypoint/OAP with a sensor (radar, FLIR, NFLR or LDT), a HUD designation, or an overfly designation. The DSG option may be selected before or after waypoint designation. When the designation has been performed and DSG option selected, sensor ranging components to the target are added to the previously entered waypoint position to give an aircraft computed position. The difference between the computed aircraft position and the onboard aircraft position produces the position error readout in bearing and range on the ACPT/REJ display. Selecting the ACPT option accepts the position update and returns the HSI display. Selecting the REJ option rejects the update and returns the HSI display. A DSG update may be performed in the A/A master mode if the designation was performed in A/G prior to entering A/A.<br>With MC OFP 13C AND UP, the selection of UPDT/DSG suspends auto sequential steering and disengages coupled steering.<br><br>. 24.2.7.2 Post Flight Update. The INS post flight update collects terminal INS maintenance data.<br><br>The post flight update is performed using the overfly designation update method. The INS determines the overfly designation update is a post flight update using the WOW transition. The aircraft must be completely stopped (parking brake engaged) to prevent erroneous terminal velocity data. The post flight update is not performed onboard ship.<br>The INS post flight update may be performed when: the parking brake is set, and the aircraft is within .01 NM (60 feet or .6 seconds) of the appropriate waypoint entered in the system (the update waypoint need not be waypoint 0). If the waypoint position is known but not programmed in the system, the position may be entered and used for the update. If no waypoints are available, no update should be attempted.<br><br>. 24.2.7.3 MAP Update. To perform a MAP update select the UPDT option on the HSI display. Now.<br><br>designate a waypoint/OAP with a sensor (radar, FLIR or LDT), a HUD designation or an overfly designation. Next select the MAP option on the update sublevel display. When this is done the word SLEW appears in the upper right corner of the HSI and the TDC is automatically assigned to the HSI (for map slewing).

When this is done the MC enters the waypoint/OAP as the aircraft present position, and the HSI display is returned. Also, the next waypoint in succession becomes designated or, in the case of an OAP, the offset becomes designated. There is no ACPT/REJ display in the AUTO update mode.<br><br>. 24.2.8 NAV/TAC Bank Limit Options (MC OFP 13C AND UP). Bank angle control 1 (BAC1) is.<br><br>engaged when any coupled steering mode is engaged. BAC1 provides aircraft steering commands and limits and maintains the aircraft on course to the selected waypoint(s), offset aim point(s), or TACAN station. BAC1 also provides steering to capture and hold a course line through the current WYPT, OAP, or TACAN station. The maximum bank limit (BLIM) is selectable on the A/C data display. TAC BLIM is used for tactical missions and limits the bank angle between ±30° and ±60° with a bank rate between 10° and 30° per second based on airspeed. NAV BLIM is used for general navigation and sets bank angle to a fixed ±30° limit with a maximum bank angle rate of 10° per second.<br>. 24.2.9 Steering. There are several types of waypoint/OAP steering described here: direct great circle,course line, auto sequential and target.<br>. 24.2.9.1 Waypoint/OAP Direct Great Circle Steering. Direct great circle steering is available in allmaster modes and is selected/deselected by actuating the WYPT/OAP option on the HI/MPCD.<br>Selecting waypoint/OAP steering deselects ILS, D/L and TACAN steering. When steering is selected, the option is boxed and direct great circle steering is provided on the HUD as shown in figure 24-12.<br>To follow a direct great circle path to the waypoint/OAP, the aircraft is turned so that the command heading steering pointer under the heading scale is centered in the heading caret. The steering provided by the steering pointer is corrected for wind drift. When the steering pointer is within ±5° of the caret as measured on the heading scale, it provides a direct indication of steering error. Between ±5° and the ends of the heading scale (±15°), the steering pointer moves non-linearly so that it is at the end of the heading scale when the steering error is 30°. The steering pointer is displayed at the end of the heading scale when the steering error is greater than 30° during a turn, the steering pointer begins to move to provide anticipation for rolling out of the turn, and then the actual steering error is indicated when within 5°. Waypoint/OAP range, identification and number is displayed on the lower right side of the HUD.<br>On the HI/MPCD, the position of the waypoint/OAP is indicated by the waypoint/OAP symbol as shown on figure 24-12. If the selected steer to point is an OAP, the position of the offset is indicated by the offset symbol. Bearing to the waypoint/OAP is indicated by the pointer inside the compass rose.<br>The waypoint/OAP symbol and pointer are displayed whether or not direct great circle steering is selected. They provide a navigation situation display only. Steering (corrected for drift) is provided only on the HUD. A digital readout of bearing and range to the waypoint/OAP is provided on the upper right corner of the HI/MPCD. Time to go to the waypoint/OAP in minutes and seconds, based upon range and present groundspeed, is provided under the bearing and range readout.<br><br>. 24.2.9.2 Waypoint/OAP Course Line Steering. Course line steering is used when it is desired to fly.<br><br>a selected course to the waypoint/OAP. To select course line steering first select direct great circle steering, then actuate the course select switch. When the course select switch is actuated, the course line appears through the waypoint/OAP symbol as shown in figure 24-13, sheet 1. The course line rotates clockwise while the course select switch is held to the right and counterclockwise while it is held to the left. A digital readout of the selected course is provided in the lower right corner of the HI/MPCD. When the waypoint/OAP symbol is beyond the range of the selected HI/MPCD scale, the waypoint/OAP symbol is limited at the inside of the compass rose coincident with the head of the pointer. The course line then rotates about the head of the pointer. It does not then overfly its correct <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-42.<br><br>

However, it does correctly indicate to which side of the aircraft the course lies and the intercept angle is correctly represented.<br>When a course line is selected, the steering on the HUD is as shown on figure 24-13, sheet 1. The arrow provides a horizontal situation indication relative to the velocity vector. As shown, the aircraft is to the right of the selected course, but is converging toward it. Two dots are displayed on the side of the velocity vector toward the steering arrow and in a line perpendicular to it. The outermost dot represents full scale deflection of the arrow (8°) and the innermost dot indicates half scale deflection (4°). If the arrow moves to the other side of the velocity vector, the dots appear on that side. The dots are not displayed when within approximately 1.25° of being on course. Figure 24-13, sheet 2 shows an example of the HUD steering arrow display as the aircraft crosses a course line. Figure 24-13, sheet 2, also shows the display as the aircraft turns to intercept a course line. The HUD situation arrow display is available only in NAV master mode, although waypoint/OAP steering can be selected and the course arrow can be displayed and used on the HI/MPCD in any master mode. However, only waypoint/OAP direct great circle steering is available on the HUD when designated. Also, course line steering can be deselected either by deselecting waypoint/OAP direct great circle steering, or by selecting a new waypoint/OAP, thus initializing direct great circle.<br><br>. 24.2.9.3 Coupled Waypoint/OAP Steering (MC OFP 13C AND UP). When waypoint steering is.<br><br>coupled CPL WYPT is displayed on the HUD and HSI display, and a CPLD advisory appears on the . DDI.

If course line steering is selected, the aircraft remains coupled and flies an outbound radial. Heading hold, and RALT or BALT (if selected) remain engaged when the aircraft passes the waypoint. If a ground point is designated, WYPT steering will not couple, or uncouples if previously coupled. If waypoint steering does not engage or disengages without being commanded, an AUTOPILOT caution is displayed on the DDI, and CPL WYPT flashes for 10 seconds on the HUD and HSI displays. The caution can be cleared with the paddle switch.<br><br>. 24.2.9.4 AUTO Sequential Steering. Before AUTO sequential steering can be selected a waypoint/.<br><br>OAP sequence must be programmed.<br>AUTO sequential steering is selected by actuating the AUTO option (AUTO boxed) on the HI/MPCD. When selected, other steering modes not compatible with AUTO sequential are deselected.<br>With AUTO sequential steering engaged, great circle steering is provided to the first waypoint/OAP in the selected sequence, see figure 24-14. When range to the steer to waypoint/OAP is less than 5 NM and bearing is greater than 90°, the next waypoint/OAP in the sequence is automatically selected.<br>Great circle steering is automatically provided for each new steer to waypoint/OAP in the sequence.<br>During AUTO sequential steering course line steering is available, however course line is deselected when the steer to waypoint/OAP is within the range and bearing mentioned above. The waypoint/OAP up/down arrows provide manual selection for steering to the desired waypoint/OAP in the sequence.<br>With AUTO sequential steering engaged, selecting the SEQ # option provides dashed lines on the HSI connecting the waypoint/OAPs of the chosen sequence, see figure 24-14.<br>AUTO sequential steering is deactivated when any of the following occur: the AUTO option deselected (unboxed), the last waypoint/OAP in the sequence is within the parameters mentioned above, selection of another steering mode, the FCS is coupled to the D/L, AUTO update is selected, a ground point is designated, magnetic heading is invalid, aircraft present position is invalid, aircraft ground track is invalid, or steering waypoint/OAP range/bearing is invalid.<br>With MC OFP 13C AND UP, auto sequential steering is suspended if UPDT/DSG is selected to perform an overfly designation. The automatic transition to the next waypoint does not take place until the update is either accepted or rejected and the sequence criteria is satisfied.<br><br>. 24.2.9.5 Coupled Auto Sequential Steering (MC OFP 13C AND UP). When auto sequential steering.<br><br>is coupled CPL SEQ #( ) (current sequence number: 1, 2, or 3 replaces the parenthesis) is displayed on the HUD and HSI display and a CPLD advisory appears on the DDI. The aircraft steers to intercept the desired course of the current WYPT/OAP in the sequence. Bank angle is limited by NAV or TAC mode as described in Chapter 2. As the aircraft gets close to the desired course, the bank angle is reduced to maintain the aircraft on the desired course. An OVFLY( ) option is available on the WYPT data option display. When this option is selected (boxed), the aircraft overflies the current WYPT/ OAP in the sequence before intercepting the course of the next one. When OVFLY( ) is not selected, the aircraft performs a lead turn to intercept the course of the next WYPT/OAP just prior to reaching the current point. Once the aircraft reaches the last point in the sequence, auto sequential steering uncouples. Heading hold and RALT or BALT (if selected) remain engaged when the aircraft passes the final point.

Coupled steering does not automatically re-engage after the update is complete.<br><br>. 24.2.9.6 Groundspeed Cuing. Before groundspeed cuing is available for display, certain criteria.<br><br>must be meant: a waypoint/OAP sequence must be entered, a target waypoint/OAP in the sequence must be selected, time of day must be entered (ZTOD or LTOD), and TOT must also be entered. With waypoint/OAP great circle steering engaged to the target waypoint/OAP, the MC calculates the groundspeed required to arrive at the target based on a direct path to the target and the entered TOT.<br>With AUTO sequential engaged, the MC calculates the groundspeed required to arrive at target waypoint/OAP taking the sequential path to the target. The MC calculates the necessary groundspeed based on the pilot entered groundspeed, providing there is enough time to travel the final leg at the entered groundspeed and arrive at the target at the TOT. However, if there is not enough time to travel the final leg at the pilot entered groundspeed, the MC ignores the pilot entered groundspeed and calculate a groundspeed to arrive at the target on time.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. • Programming a required groundspeed is not necessary for ground-speed cuing calculations.<br>. • The designated target waypoint/OAP must be in the waypoint/OAPsequence in order for the required groundspeed cueing function to operate.<br>If the target is an OAP the groundspeed required calculation includes the distance from the OAP to the offset. If the target is NAV designated the MC uses the NAV designation location in the calculation of groundspeed required for TOT. Also, once the target waypoint/OAP is NAV designated, any other designation means may be used to adjust the designation and the groundspeed calculation continues to be calculated to the adjusted designation.<br>HUD cuing of required groundspeed consists of a tick mark and arrow head located under the airspeed box. The arrow head is referenced to the tick mark, to indicate if the aircraft is traveling too fast or too slow to reach the target on time. The arrow head is displayed to the left of the tick mark when the aircraft is traveling too slow and displayed to the right of the tick mark when the traveling too fast. Full displacement of the arrow head left or right of the tick mark indicates a difference of 30 knots between actual and required groundspeed. The aircraft is traveling the correct speed when the arrow head is centered on the tick mark. The required groundspeed readout is displayed on the HI/MPCD under the present ground speed readout.

            described in the NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP. Designating a waypoint/OAP instigates the following changes on the HI/MPCD: the NAVDSG option is removed/replaced with the O/S option, WYPT/ OAP is replaced with a boxed TGT/OAP legend, the waypoint symbol is replaced with the target diamond, the waypoint symbol inside the waypoint steering pointer is also replaced with the target diamond and the steering information in the upper right corner now relates to the target. Designating a waypoint/OAP also provides the following changes on the HUD: a target diamond appears below the heading scale to provide target heading information, another target diamond also appears indicating the target line of sight (LOS) and the WYPT data (range) on the lower right corner is replaced with TGT data. HUD target steering operates the same as described for waypoint/OAP great circle steering.<br><br>. 24.2.10.1 NAVDSG (Navigation) Designation. Selecting the NAVDSG option designates the way-.<br><br>point as a target, with the changes mentioned above appearing at designation, see figure 24-15.<br>To NAVDSG an OAP the procedure is slightly different. When the NAVDSG option is selected the OAP is designated and all data for the designated target on the HI/MPCD and HUD operates the same as described above, except for the following: the NAVDSG legend is replaced with the O/S option, and the OAP option is boxed. The O/S option must now be selected to add the offset data to the OAP position which completes the designation. Another method of adding the offset data to the OAP position (completing the designation) is to assign the TDC to the HI/MPCD then actuate the TDC.<br>When this occurs, the O/S legend is removed, the boxed OAP legend is replaced with a boxed TGT legend, the offset symbol is replaced with the target diamond and the designated aimpoint reverts to the aimpoint symbol. A NAVDSG cannot be performed if a waypoint/OAP is already designated, see figure 24-15.<br><br>. 24.2.10.2 Overfly Designation. An overfly designation is performed on a waypoint/OAP by pressing.<br><br>the TDC while it is assigned to the HI/MPCD and the aircraft is overflying the waypoint/OAP. When this happens the MC assumes that the aircraft is over the waypoint/OAP and the aircraft present position at that time is designated as the waypoint/OAP position. In the case of an OAP the offset data is automatically added to the aircraft present position to complete the designation. When an overfly designation is performed the changes mentioned above occur, see figure 24-16.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-49.<br><br>

Bearing information received by the ADF is sent to the MC where the data is processed to position the ADF bearing pointer on the HI/MPCD. The channel to the station to which ADF bearing is required is selected on the comm 1 or comm 2 radio.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-54.<br><br>

            The ADF system is turned on using the ADF function selector switch on the UFC. Placing the switch to the 1 position applies power to the ADF and indicates ADF bearing to the station selected on the comm 1 radio. Placing the switch to the 2 position applies power to the ADF and indicates ADF bearing to the station selected on the comm 2 radio. Placing the switch to the OFF position removes power from the ADF. ADF audio is adjusted by either the comm 1 or comm 2 volume control knob. ADF symbology appears as a small circle on the HI/MPCD.<br><br>. 24.4 TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation).<br><br>The RT-1159A/ARN-118 TACAN system gives precise relative bearing and/or slant range distance to a TACAN ground station or range to a suitably equipped aircraft. The TACAN system operates in the L-Band frequency range, limiting the operating range to line of sight which depends upon aircraft altitude. The maximum operating range is 390 nm when the selected TACAN station is a surface beacon and 200 nm when the selected TACAN station is an airborne beacon. The aircraft receives a three letter morse code signal to identify the beacon being received. When operating in conjunction with aircraft having air-to-air capability, the A/A mode provides line of sight distance between two aircraft operating their TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up to five aircraft can determine line of sight distance from a sixth lead aircraft in the A/A mode.<br>In MIDS-equipped aircraft, TACAN functionality is embedded in the MIDS terminal, replacing the AN/ARN-118 in door 13R. To preclude MIDS interference with the IFF system, notch frequency filters were placed in the MIDS TACAN antenna lines. The upper filter is fixed, while the lower filter is switched in for LINK-16 transmissions, and out for TACAN transmissions and all reception. Because the upper antenna filter is fixed, it filters A/A TACAN frequencies on channels 1-36 and 64-99 (X and . Y). A/A TACAN channels should be chosen outside of these ranges. The upper filter makes the topantenna unusable for T/R (Air to Ground) TACAN channels 1-29 X and Y, 47X to 63X and 64Y to 92Y. For TACAN channels in these ranges, the bottom antenna is the only antenna for TACAN. With a centerline tank installed, the antenna is blocked approximately 180°± 15° relative to the aircraft nose. This shadowing of the bottom antenna, combined with the lower transmitter power of the MIDS (200W versus 1000W for AN/ARN-118), causes reduced ranges for DME at channels within the range of the filter when flying directly away from the TACAN station. Flight test data at afloat stations shows that maximum tail-aspect DME ranges of approximately 22 nm at 6,000 feet and 26 nm at 15,000 feet can be expected to make DME unreliable when headed outbound in the marshal stack. At shore stations, flight tests have shown substantially better tail-aspect DME ranges (e.g. 52 nm at 15,000 feet).<br>DME ranges in the forward and side quadrants of the aircraft, and bearing performance in all quadrants, are not impacted. Therefore, approach performance on the affected channels is nominal.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>MIDS equipped aircraft may experience TACAN bearing and DME dropouts. MIDS equipped aircraft with a centerline tank may experience loss of DME during outbound legs from TACAN stations 1 to 29X and Y, 47X to 63X and 64Y to 92Y.<br><br>. 24.4.1 TACAN BIT. To manually initiate a TACAN BIT check, ensure the TACAN is turned on, then.<br><br>press the TCN/IFF option on the BIT sublevel display. If the TACAN is good, the DDI shows the BIT status as GO. If the TACAN does not pass the BIT check, the BIT status shows DEGD. The TACAN system also has an automatically initiated BIT. If the automatic BIT check detects a wrong signal or a failure, a TACAN DEGD is displayed on the DDI BIT display and the BIT line on the left DDI. If no fault is detected, nothing is displayed next to TCN. In MIDS equipped aircraft, the only way to execute a TACAN BIT is by initiating a MIDS BIT. To run a MIDS BIT, MIDS must be selected in the COMM submenu of the BIT display.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-55.<br><br>

These TACAN steering options are mechanized identical to waypoint/ OAP direct great circle and course line steering, with steering being referenced to the TACAN.<br>Selecting the TCN option on the HSI display provides TACAN direct great circle, see figure 24-19.<br>Activating the CSEL switch with TACAN direct great circle already selected provides TACAN course line steering, see figure 24-20.<br><br>. 24.4.5.2 Coupled TACAN Steering (F/A-18A after AFC 253 or 292 and F/A-18C/D). When TACAN.<br><br>steering is coupled CPL TCN is displayed on the HUD and HSI display, and a CPLD advisory appears on the DDI. The aircraft steers to intercept the desired course line, or flies to the TACAN station if no course line is selected. Bank angle is limited by NAV or TAC mode as described in chapter 1. As the aircraft gets close to the desired course, the bank angle is reduced to maintain the aircraft on the desired course. If a course line is selected, the aircraft continues past the TACAN station on the outbound radial until the mode is decoupled. If no course line is selected, TACAN steering uncouples when the aircraft reaches the TACAN station. Heading hold and RALT or BALT (if selected) remain engaged when the aircraft passes the TACAN station. If TACAN steering does not engage or disengages without being commanded, an AUTOPILOT caution is displayed on the DDI, and CPL TCN flashes for 10 seconds on the HUD and HSI displays. The caution can be cleared with the paddle switch.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-24-57.<br><br>

            . 24.5 ILS (INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM).<br><br>The AN/ARA-63A ILS is an all weather approach guidance system which operates with an aircraft carrier installed transmitting set AN/SPN-41. The ILS decodes transmitted azimuth and elevation signals during an approach and provides steering information for display on the HUD, standby attitude reference indicator, and on F/A-18C/D aircraft the EADI. The major components of the AN/ARA-63A system are a receiver and decoder.<br><br>. 24.5.1 ILS Receiver. The ILS receiver receives coded transmissions of azimuth and elevation.<br><br>guidance data from surface transmitters. The receiver transforms these signals into coded pulses suitable for processing in the decoder. A BIT module for system BIT check is contained within the receiver.<br><br>. 24.5.2 ILS Decoder. The ILS decoder receives and decodes azimuth and elevation pulses from the.<br><br>receiver, and converts them to azimuth and elevation command signals for the HUD and standby attitude reference indicator.<br><br>. 24.5.3 ILS BIT. To manually initiate an ILS BIT check, ensure the ILS is on, then select the.<br><br>ILS/AUG/BCN/D/L option on the BIT sublevel display.

            . 24.6 DATA LINK SYSTEM.<br><br>All information on the data link systems (i.e., LINK 4 and LINK 16), except for the automatic carrier landing mode, is contained in the NTRP 3-22.2-FA18A-D NATIP. For typical Automatic Carrier Landing procedures, refer to Chapter 8.<br><br>. 24.6.1 Automatic Carrier Landing Mode. The system for automatic landing of aircraft onto the.<br><br>aircraft carrier deck comprises the AN/SPN-42 installed aboard the carrier and Automatic Carrier Landing (ACL) equipment installed in the aircraft. The aircraft data link system is the ACL component over which steering commands are received from the carrier for guidance of the aircraft.<br>The data link ACL mode is available only when the NAV master mode is selected. The ACL steering commands may be coupled to the flight control computer for fully automatic approaches to touchdown, or the pilot may elect to use the steering displays for a manually controlled landing. The traffic control (T/C) mode is a submode of ACL. The T/C mode provides data link heading commands to aid the pilot in reaching the marshal point and/or it may be used for azimuth alignment from marshal until ACL acquisition. These heading commands can be coupled to the flight control computer for automatic lateral axis control or can be used for manual steering aids.<br>Two uplinked control messages (label 5 and label 6) are uniquely addressed to a specific aircraft and received via the data link for ACL mode (and T/C submode) control and display. The label 5 message only is used for T/C mode, while both label 5 and label 6 are required for ACL modes 1, 1A, and 2 control and display. The contents of the uplinked label 5 and label 6 messages follows:<br><br>Label 5 Message.<br><br>Command Altitude (feet) Displayed on Link 4/SA display.<br>Command Airspeed (knots) Displayed on Link 4/SA display.<br><br>Command Rate of Descent.<br><br>(feet per minute) Displayed on Link 4/SA display.<br>Command Heading Displayed on Link 4/SA and HUD.<br><br>Group 1 Discretes ACL RDY, CMD CNT, LND CHK, NOT.<br><br>CMD, W/O, and CHG CHNL.<br>Group 2a Discretes Monitor altitude and altitude change Warning Receipt of either discrete causes the command altitude and command rate of descent to be un- derlined on the Link 4/SA display.<br>Group 2b Discretes Monitor speed and speed change warning.

When an uplinked label 5 message is received, a determination.<br><br>is automatically made relative to total loop capability. If the ACL loop is ready for a T/C couple, the T/C cue appears on the Link 4/SA display and autopilot options are initialized on the upfront control with the CPL option displayed (figure 24-25). The prerequisites for a CPL option for T/C follow:<br>. 1. Onboard systems fully operational.. 2. Valid label 5 message received.. 3. Waveoff (W/O) discrete not received.. 4. Uplinked information being updated (no TILT cue).. 5. NOT CMD discrete not being received.. 6. Label 6 message not being received.With T/C displayed FCS couple is selected by actuating the CPL option button on the UFC. When coupling to the T/C heading command is successful a colon is displayed in front of the CPL option on the UFC and the CPLD HDG cue is displayed on the HUD. After couple the FCS will bank the aircraft to maximum of 30° to capture and hold the uplinked heading command.

When an uplinked label 6 message is received, a determination is made with.<br><br>respect to total loop capability relative to dual-axis (lateral and longitudinal) ACL couple. If ACL couple is determined to be available, the MODE 1 cue is displayed on the Link 4/SA display and the autopilot options are initialized on the UFC with CPL option displayed as shown in figure 24-26.<br>When the pilot selects the CPL option on the UFC, an ACL couple to the FCS is requested if proper prerequisites are met.<br><br>NOTE.<br><br>. •If FCS is already coupled to T/C command heading, the firstactuation of the CPL option disengages T/C couple and a second actuation requests ACL couple.<br>. •Mode 1 is available only with full flaps selected.<br>The MC prerequisites for initial ACL couple are as follows:<br><br>. 1. Basic FCS outer loop (heading hold) engaged. If heading hold is not engaged when the CPLoption is actuated it is automatically requested, and when FCS indicates it is engaged, ACL couple is requested.<br>. 2. Onboard test results indicate ACL 1 capability.. 3. Uplinked ACL RDY discrete being received. ACL RDY is only required for initial couple. It is notrequired after ACL couple occurs.<br>. 4. Uplinked A/P bit set to couple state.. 5. Valid uplinked longitudinal and lateral axes commands being received (no TILT).To indicate FCS is coupled, a colon is displayed next to CPL option on the UFC and the CPLD P/R cue is displayed on the HUD. When ACL couple initially occurs, the FCS fades in the longitudinal and lateral uplinked commands to minimize engagement transients. After FCS is coupled to the dual-axis commands, the FCS limits the accepted magnitude of the uplinked commands to prevent excessive pitch or roll changes due to large and/or erroneous uplinked commands. When FCS is coupled to ACL, uncouple will occur, with reversion as noted, for any of the following reasons.<br>. 1. Heading hold mode disengagement with reversion to CAS operation.. 2.

For an ACL mode 1A approach, the aircraft may be coupled to data link.<br><br>commands as described in the Mode 1 paragraph, then uncoupled at minimums (200 feet and 0.5 mile) and manual control as described for Mode 2 used the rest of the way to touchdown.<br><br>. 24.6.1.2.5 ACL Mode 2. When a label 6 message is initially received and a mode 1 or mode 2.<br><br>capability exists, a mode 2 manual approach may be made. The data link HUD steering which may be manually selected with the D/L option button on the HI is automatically selected. The D/L legend on the HI is boxed and the data link situation steering tadpole is displayed on the HUD with the tadpole referenced to the velocity vector as shown in figure 24-27. The ILS situation display may remain selected on the HUD for crosscheck on the D/L situation display and/or either D/L or ILS display may be deselected by actuating the option button on the HI. Mode 2 approaches may be made with or without ATC engaged, but if available, ATC should be used for angle of attack/airspeed control.

            CHAPTER 25.<br><br><br>Backup/Degraded Operations.<br><br><br>. 25.1 MISSION COMPUTER NO. 1 FAILURE.<br><br>If there is a failure of MC 1 (navigation computer), there are certain capabilities which are lost. The flight control computer is not provided with g limiter and stores information. The FCC reverts to a 7.5 g aircraft with no roll rate limiting for stores. The control of CNI equipment via the UFC is not affected by an MC 1 failure. Full Attack display and some basic Store display capability exists. MC 2 provides limited backup for the functions described below.<br><br>. 25.1.1 Status Monitoring Functions. MC 2 provides limited backup for status monitoring functions.<br><br>MC 1, HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A and HYD 2B cautions are available. An AUTO PILOT caution is displayed if MC 1 fails while autopilot is selected. A backup Master Caution tone is provided when voice alerts are not available. The data link advisories displayed during backup operation are TILT, <br>W/O and 10 SEC.<br><br>Failure of MC 1 causes a loss of all DDI caution displays except AUTO PILOT, MC 1, HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A, and HYD 2B.<br><br>. 25.1.2 Navigation Functions. Some basic navigation capabilities are provided by the backup.<br><br>functions of MC 2. Functions not available when MC 1 is failed are the autopilot functions, the HI/MPCD map and navigation situations display, EGI GPS or GPS and the HUD steering displays (except for data link). In addition, the HSI functions of selecting the position keeping source, position updating, target marking, and data entry and display are not provided when MC 1 is failed. The functions provided by MC 2 are the basic HUD flight data, a backup HSI display with INS, TACAN and ADF information, a mode II ACL capability, and automatic throttle control. ILS steering is available on the standby attitude indicator. If the INS fails when MC 1 is failed, no backup position keeping is provided. In this case the standby attitude reference indicator is used by MC 2 for attitude information and the velocity vector is not displayed on the HUD.<br><br>. 25.1.3 Backup HUD Display. With MC 1 failed, the backup HUD display is identical with the.<br><br>primary HUD display, except that the bank angle scale is not provided and the heading scale is at the same position as in the weapon delivery modes. The ghost velocity vector is provided during backup operation, and the velocity vector may be caged/uncaged. The landing HUD display and data link steering are still available. On the ground, the position of the velocity vector and the pitch ladder may be erratic. In some cases the velocity vector may be removed from the HUD.<br><br>. 25.1.4 Backup HSI Display. With MC 1 failed, the backup HSI display consists of a magnetic.<br><br>compass rose oriented heading-up with a TACAN pointer and an ADF pointer. A digital readout of TACAN bearing and distance and the station identifier are provided in the upper left corner. The INS present position is displayed inside the compass rose at the top center. Waypoint 0 position is also displayed. The ACL mode option pushbutton is also displayed for selection if desired.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-25-1.<br><br>

            . 25.2 BACKUP ATTITUDE AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM.<br><br>If a failure occurs in the primary attitude and navigation system (INS), output signals of pitch, roll, magnetic heading, and airspeed are provided to the mission computer system for use in the backup attitude navigation computations. The backup system consists of a standby attitude reference indicator, a static power inverter, and a magnetic azimuth detector.<br><br>. 25.2.1 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator. The standby attitude reference indicator (figure.<br><br>25-1) is a self-contained pitch and roll instrument on the main instrument panel. An electrically driven vertical gyro maintains vertical orientation by use of an electronic erection system. The erection system automatically cuts off the roll erection circuit when lateral accelerations exceed approximately 0.15 g, the pitch erection circuit remains active. The gyro spin speed and erection system provides a minimum of 3 minutes of attitude information with a total power loss. Pitch and roll synchros provide backup pitch and roll attitude for use by other systems. The attitude presentation is 360° in roll, 92° in climb, and 78° in dive.<br>. 25.2.2 Static Power Inverter. If there is an interruption or loss of aircraft ac power, 28 volt dc poweris applied to the static power inverter to produce the 115 volt ac power needed for standby attitude reference indicator operation.<br><br>. 25.2.3 Magnetic Azimuth Detector. The magnetic azimuth detector (MAD) consists of 3 sensing.<br><br>elements configured in a wye. The sensing elements are mounted so that their average positions are maintained in the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic field. The air data computer processes the detected magnetic heading and develops the magnetic error compensation signals.<br><br>. 25.2.4 Backup Attitude and Navigation System Controls and Indicators. The controls and indica-.<br><br>tors for the backup system are on the HI/MPCD and the standby attitude reference indicator.<br><br>. 25.2.4.1 HI/MPCD. The HI/MPCD provides horizontal situation and steering control displays.<br><br><br>. 25.2.4.2 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator Controls and Indicators. The controls and indica-.<br><br>tors on the standby attitude reference indicator (figure 25-1) are described as follows:<br>. 1. OFF flag. This flag is in view when power is removed or the pull to cage knob is pulled out or doesnot properly retract.<br>. 2. Miniature airplane. This represents the nose and wings of the airplane and indicates pitch androll attitude relative to the horizon. The miniature airplane is adjustable from +5° thru -10° of pitch trim by rotating the pull to cage knob clockwise or counterclockwise when the knob is pushed in.<br>. 3. Pull to cage knob. When the knob is pulled out and held it orients the gyro spin axis to the ARIcase (pitch and roll position). When the knob is pulled out and rotated clockwise to engage detent the ARI becomes caged.<br>Damage to the gyro might occur if the indicator is moved rapidly in the pitch or roll axes while the gyro is spinning and caged. If the knob is in the locked position, it must be pulled out to clear the detent before it can be turned counterclockwise.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-25-2.<br><br>

            various failure conditions, alternate sources of heading, attitude and/or velocity information may be used for position keeping. The backup heading modes are discussed in a following paragraph. The attitude reference indicator is the alternate source of attitude information. The alternate sources of velocity information are GPS and air data (true airspeed and angle of attack) or radar doppler velocities. Air data vertical velocity is an alternate velocity source if only the vertical component of INS velocity is invalid. The flight control set is an alternate source for angle of attack information.<br>The system automatically reverts to alternate data sources under failure conditions. For example, GPS (if installed), MIDS (if installed), or air data position keeping (in that order) is automatically selected in case of an INS failure. If MIDS is installed and operating, MIDS will be automatically selected as the aircraft position keeping source when INS or GPS (if installed) fails. Because MIDS position keeping is unreliable, air data position keeping (POS/ADC) should be manually selected if POS/MIDS is displayed. During air data position keeping, true airspeed and angle of attack from the air data computer and the last computed wind, or the wind inserted by the pilot via the UFC, are used.<br>The wind can also be updated during air data position keeping by performing a velocity update. A new wind is calculated when the velocity update is accepted. The velocity vector on the HUD is flashed at a slow rate (on for 0.8 seconds and off for 0.8 seconds) during air data position keeping. A POS/ADC caution is displayed on the DDI along with a master caution light and tone, when the INS reverts to <br>ADC position keeping.<br><br>The radar doppler velocities are automatically used by the mission computer if they are available and no other velocity sources are available (INS, GPS and ADC failed). This applies whether or not TACAN position keeping is selected. Doppler velocities are available when the radar is operating in a doppler beam sharpened (DBS) mode or PVU mode. Thus, the MC automatically uses the doppler velocities under these conditions if a DBS mode is selected, or if velocity update is selected (without accepting or rejecting the update).<br><br>. 25.3.1 Navigation Controls and Indicators.<br><br><br>. 25.3.1.1 HI/MPCD Display. The symbols and digital readouts that normally appear on the.<br><br>HI/MPCD during backup system operation are the same as in the INS operation except for the POS <br>OPTION DISPLAY description.<br><br><br>. 25.3.1.2 POS Option Display. Pressing the POS/ADC pushbutton on the HSI display commands the.<br><br>mission computer system to use air data computer true air speed, MAD heading, wind speed, and direction to compute aircraft latitude and longitude in waypoint steering computation.<br><br>. 25.3.2 Backup Heading Mode Control. If the INS computer should fail or if the INS switch is.<br><br>rotated to the GYRO position, the ASN-130 INS reverts to the attitude heading reference system (AHRS) mode and true heading is no longer available from the INS. In this case, the mission computer slaves the INS platform heading with the MAD to provide damped magnetic heading. The slaving of the INS platform to the MAD occurs in straight and level flight. During maneuvers, when roll is greater than ±5° or pitch is greater than ±10°, the MAD output is not used. Upon reversion to the Slaved heading mode, the bottom row of option selections on the HSI are HDG/SLV, SYNC, and ERECT.<br>The sync option can be used to quickly synchronize the heading with the MAD output if a heading error exists. The MC automatically synchronizes the heading with the MAD output when the heading error is greater than 11.25° during level flight. Pressing the ERECT option commands the INS to increase the gains in the INS erection loops, thus fast-leveling the platform. SYNC and ERECT are momentary options and they should be used only in straight and level flight. Back up heading is not available with the ASN-139 and EGI.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-25-4.<br><br>

            If it is desired to change the backup heading mode, the heading status option pushbutton should be pressed (HDG/SLV in this case) and the available heading options (SLV, DG, and COMP) are presented on the HSI. Selecting any of these three options commands the MC to display the selected option and necessary controls for that option. In the case of failure conditions, the next best available source is automatically selected.<br>Selection of the DG heading mode or failure of the MAD while in the HDG/SLV mode, causes the bottom pushbuttons on the HI/MPCD to display HDG/DG, HDG (arrow left), HDG (arrow right), and ERECT. The MC computes aircraft heading using the INS platform heading as a smoothed heading source compensating for wander angle (the difference between true north and platform heading) and earth rate. The pilot may correct the aircraft heading by using the two HDG slew option buttons.<br>Following the initial setting of the heading, the MC provides heading compensation for earth rate.<br>However, changes in magnetic variation must be entered via the upfront control since the aircraft uses the last known value of magnetic variation.<br>If the pilot selects the Compass heading mode, if the INS is turned off, or if the INS fails completely, the mission computer uses the MAD output, damped with body rate data from the flight control system. During maneuvers, when roll is greater than ±5° or pitch is greater than ±10°, the flight control system body rates, alone, are used to determine heading. In the compass heading (HDG/COMP) mode, the bottom buttons are labeled HDG/COMP and ERECT. The ERECT option is displayed only when the ASN-130 INS is still operating in the AHRS mode. The MC uses the last known magnetic variation to compute true heading.<br><br>. 25.4 BACKUP FREQUENCY CONTROL.<br><br>Backup frequency control for the radios in case of an upfront control or communication system control (CSC) malfunction is provided via the multiplex bus and a DDI display. The UFC backup (UFC BU) display can be selected from the menu. Both Comm 1 and Comm 2 can be controlled from the UFC BU display. When the COM1 or COM2 button is pressed, the frequency on which that radio is operating is displayed below the legend COM1 or COM2, as appropriate. A new frequency is selected by first selecting OVRD and then using the numerical buttons along the sides of the display and ENT button at the bottom. With MC OFP 10A AND UP, four digit frequencies can be entered. Four digits limit the frequency resolution to 100KHz. With MC OFP 13C AND UP, six digit frequencies can be entered. Frequencies can be entered to 5 KHz of resolution. As the new frequency is entered, it is displayed in the scratch pad above the COM1 or COM2 legend. When the ENT button is pressed, the frequency displayed in the scratchpad is stored in the mission computer as the preset frequency for the radio. Pressing the CLR button clears the scratchpad if an error is made when entering a backup frequency. When OVRD option in the upper right corner of the display is selected, it is boxed and the radio operates on the preset frequency stored for it in the mission computer, overriding the normal frequency control from the UFC and CSC. When OVRD is deselected, frequency control reverts to the upfront control. The frequency displayed below the COM1 or COM2 legend is always the frequency on which the radio is operating, whether or not OVRD is selected. Upon power up with WOW, the preset frequencies stored in the mission computer for COM1 and COM2 are initialized to be the same as the last valid radio operating frequencies.<br>If the radio is operating in AJ mode, AJ is displayed in place of the frequency display. If the radio is operating in AJ when OVRD is selected, the radio automatically tunes to the new frequency and exits <br>AJ mode.<br><br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALVII-25-5 (Reverse Blank).<br><br>

            CHAPTER 28.<br><br><br>Crew Resource Management.<br><br><br>. 28.1 DEFINITION.<br><br>Crew resource management is the use and integration of all available skills and resources to collectively achieve and maintain flight efficiency, situational awareness, and mission effectiveness.<br>Effective crew coordination is essential for aircraft employment; however F/A-18 crew coordination differs from previous crew served tactical aircraft in that ‘‘who does what when’’ is determined by the mission and mission phase and not by where equipment controls are located in the cockpit. The most successful crews are those who have flown together extensively and know each other’s areas of responsibility before manning the aircraft. The mission commander is responsible for mission success.<br>The pilot as the aircraft commander is solely responsible for the safe control of the aircraft throughout the entire mission. Crewmembers/WSOs assist the pilot as necessary and should anticipate develop- ments. The responsibility for every evolution is a shared responsibility. Crew coordination provides a system of checks and balances which, properly utilized, ensure effective and efficient mission accomplishment.<br><br>. 28.2 CRITICAL SKILLS OF CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.<br><br><br>. 28.2.1 Decision Making. Effective decision making refers to the ability to use logical and sound.<br><br>judgement to make decisions based on available information. This includes assessing the problem, verifying information, identifying solutions, anticipating the consequences of decisions, informing others of the decision and rationale, and evaluating these decisions. Good decisions optimize risk management and minimize errors, while poor decisions can increase them and is a leading cause of failure to complete missions and of mishaps.<br>. 28.2.2 Assertiveness. Assertiveness refers to the ability, willingness, and readiness to take action.This involves making decisions, demonstrating initiative and the courage to act, and stating and maintaining a position until convinced otherwise by the facts. Each flight member must be willing to act assertively if they are going to fulfil their responsibility toward mission success.<br>. 28.2.3 Mission Analysis. Mission effectiveness relies on the aircrew’s ability to coordinate, allocate,and monitor flight and aircraft resources. Mission analysis includes organizing and planning for what will occur during the mission, monitoring the current situation, and reviewing and providing feedback on what has occurred. Failure to develop a good plan, or to revise a plan when the situation changes, can result in a failed mission or a mishap.<br><br>. 28.2.4 Communication. Effective aircrew communication skills ensure timely transfer and assimi-.<br><br>lation of accurate information and provide useful feedback. Open professional communication that avoids defensiveness and encourages accurate understanding of the intended message is critical to the information flow in the flight. Aviators should be aware of the basic sociological, psychological, and environmental barriers to communication and attempt to overcome them.<br>. 28.2.5 Leadership. Leadership is the ability to direct and coordinate the activities of the mission andto stimulate the flight to work together as a team. The ultimate responsibility for safety of flight rests with the aircraft commander/pilot in command. Every crewmember however has the responsibility <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIX-28-1.<br><br>

            toward safety of flight, compliance with NATOPS and SOPs, and mission accomplishment. Within the chain of command each crewmember must exercise vigilance and support the aircraft commander with timely recommendations and back up as directed.<br>. 28.2.6 Adaptability/Flexibility. The ability to alter one’s course of action, another’s action and/orsituational demands demonstrates good adaptability/flexibility. The critical aspects of being adaptable are anticipating problems, recognizing and acknowledging any changes or abnormalities, taking alternative actions, providing and asking for assistance, and interacting constructively with flight members. The success of a mission depends on the ability to alter behavior and dramatically manage flight resources to meet situational demands.<br><br>. 28.2.7 Situational Awareness. Situational awareness is the accurate comprehension of all factors.<br><br>affecting the aircraft. It is the ability to identify the source and nature of problems, extract and interpret essential information, maintain an accurate perception of the external environment, and detect a situation requiring action. Mission accomplishment depends on the level of situational awareness of all members of the flight and outside agencies.<br><br>. 28.2.8 Factors That Degrade Crew Resource Management.<br><br>. 1. Fixation on one task to the detriment of others.. 2. Confusion.. 3. Violation of NATOPS/FLIGHT minimums.. 4. Violations of SOP.. 5. No one in charge.. 6. No lookout doctrine.. 7. Failure to meet mission/planning milestones.. 8. Absence of communications.<br>. 28.3 FLIGHT MEMBER POSITIONS.<br><br><br>. 28.3.1 Mission Commander. The mission commander shall be a qualified naval aviator or naval.<br><br>flight officer designated by appropriate authority. The mission commander shall be responsible for all phases of the assigned mission except those aspects of safety of flight which are related to the physical control of aircraft and fall within the prerogatives of the pilot in command. In accomplishing this, the mission commander may exercise command over a single naval aircraft or formations of naval aircraft.<br>The mission commander shall direct a coordinated plan of action and be responsible for effectiveness of the mission. The mission commander’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:<br>. 1. Allocation of assets.. 2. Supervise and allocate planning tasks.. 3. Assess capabilities and limitations of the flight.. 4. Establish go/no-go criteria.<br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIX-28-2.<br><br>

            . 5. Assign roles and responsibilities.. 6. Ensure compliance with applicable orders, directives and ROE/ROC.. 7. Delegate authority as required.<br>. 28.3.2 Pilot In Command. The pilot in command is the pilot of an individual aircraft. The pilot in.<br><br>command is responsible for the safe, orderly flight of the aircraft and well-being of the crew. In the absence of direct orders from higher authority cognizant of the mission, responsibility for starting or continuing a mission with respect to weather or any other condition affecting the safety of the aircraft rests with the pilot in command. The pilot in command may also be mission commander or formation leader when so designated.<br><br>. 28.3.3 Formation Leader. A formation of two or more Naval aircraft shall be under the direction of.<br><br>a formation leader who is authorized to pilot Naval aircraft. The formation leader is responsible for the safe and orderly conduct of the formation. The status of each member of the formation shall be clearly briefed and understood prior to takeoff. The formation leader may also be the mission commander when so designated.<br><br>. 28.3.4 Crew Member. Personnel whose presence is required on board an aircraft to perform crew.<br><br>functions in support of the assigned mission (i.e. copilot, bombardier/navigator, weapons and sensors officer, air observer, special crew, trainee, etc.).<br><br>. 28.3.5 Weapons and Sensors Officer. The Weapons and Sensors Officer (WSO) is directly involved.<br><br>in all operations and weapons systems employment of the F/A-18 aircraft except actual control of the aircraft. The WSO integrates with the pilot to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness, and mission effectiveness. When designated as mission commander, the WSO is also responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, except those aspects of safety of flight which are related to the actual physical control of the aircraft and fall within the prerogatives of the pilot in command.<br><br>. 28.4 AIRCREW RESPONSIBILITIES BY FLIGHT PHASE.<br><br><br>. 28.4.1 Mission Planning and Briefing. All members of the flight should be involved in the mission.<br><br>planning process and must be familiar with the mission requirements prior to the flight brief.<br>The flight brief shall be conducted with all members of the flight present. Any supporting assets (GCI, fighter escort, EW, etc.) shall be briefed face-to-face if possible. Flights requiring special coordination or control should also be briefed face-to-face. Each type of flight or phase of flight may require unique briefing requirements.<br><br>. 28.4.2 Pretakeoff. AOB review, preflight, prestart and poststart evolutions are conducted individu-.<br><br>ally or jointly, for dual crewmember flights, with the aid of ground maintenance crews (plane captains, trouble shooters, ordnance, etc.) Timing must be considered when coordinating operations with other activities. Marshalling and taxi with a flight should be in order with special emphasis on FOD avoidance. A minimum taxi interval should be emphasized for FOD considerations. During section taxi the wingman cannot focus on other tasks or allow himself to get behind.<br>A challenge/reply acknowledgment is required in dual crewmember aircraft prior to canopy repositioning and during the accomplishment of takeoff/landing checklist procedures. The use of HOTMIKE should be considered during ground/flight phases where immediate action is required.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIX-28-3.<br><br>

            . 28.4.3 Takeoff/Departure. The following should also be considered and briefed when conducting a.<br><br>formation takeoff in addition to the typical takeoff considerations such as gross weight, performance, <br>and abort capability:<br><br>. - interval for FOD avoidance. - staggered line-up for abort. - cross wind handling characteristics. - jet exhaust/turbulence patterns. - abort criteria and configuration changes prior to IMC. - wingman position. - airspeed. - runway. - abortDeparture procedures are dependent upon weather and mission requirements.<br>The following are some considerations that may require crew coordination:<br>. - clearance compliance. - climb schedule and interval of multiplane formations. - weather avoidance or penetration. - individual departure to join on top.<br>. 28.4.4 Enroute. Enroute procedures may differ greatly depending on mission requirements. Some.<br><br><br>task assignment and execution considerations are:<br><br>. - navigation (INS management). - specific sensor usage (i.e. radar, TFLIR). - communications. - lookout. - transition TO/FROM NVG equipment usage. - weapon employment programming‘‘Who does what to what when’’ should be in sufficient detail as to preclude redundant and possibly negative effort.<br><br>. 28.4.5 Recovery. Egress, approach and landing options are numerous and dependent upon mission.<br><br>objectives, weather, and types of landing. The following elements should be considered and may require crew resource management: navigation and communication systems management, course rules, re-entry procedures, approach and landing weather, landing type and capabilities (i.e. gross weight, crosswind limitations, aircraft configuration), fuel for normal and alternate recoveries, formation size and composition based upon maneuverability and landing area congestion, instrument recovery/ penetration procedures (single aircraft and/or formation), power and maneuvering margins for wingmen, jet wash and turbulence avoidance, terminal control/LSO procedures, landing interval and priorities, FOD avoidance during landing and taxi, and dearming procedures.<br>. 28.4.6 Mission Critique. Mission assessment is critical following a flight whether the mission was amulti-aircraft strike, an FCLP period, or a functional check flight. A critical and credible debrief of mission effectiveness improves future mission success and enhances aircrew and supporting agency coordination. A proper debrief should provide flight members and supporting agencies with informa- tion on strengths and weaknesses so that future training and mission planning can focus on problem areas and exploit strong areas.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIX-28-4.<br><br>

            . 28.5 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.<br><br><br>. 28.5.1 Functional Checkflights. All requirements for functional checkflights are listed in COM-.<br><br>NAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 series and are to be performed using the applicable functional check flight checklist. Crew coordination shall be in accordance with standard NATOPS procedures and apply during the entire checkflight. F/A-18 NATOPS chapter 10 outlines additional checks to establish acceptance standards for the systems peculiar to the F/A-18 aircraft. All instrument and indicator readings, warning lights, and radar and navigation displays in the aft cockpit will be compared throughout the flight with the corresponding information available from the front cockpit. Close crew coordination ensures proper and correct utilization of all functional check flight procedures. Only those pilots and aircrew/WSOs designated in writing by the squadron commanding officer shall perform squadron functional checkflights.<br><br>. 28.5.2 Formation Flights. Formation flights involving two or more aircraft require a high degree of.<br><br>crew coordination to ensure mission accomplishment and to reduce the mid air collision potential to a minimum. During all missions involving formation flights in either VFR or IFR weather, the aircrew/WSO should aid in the operation of the aircraft radar, sensors, and weapons system. The pilot should be able to devote primary attention to flying the aircraft and maintaining sight of all other aircraft in the flight.<br><br>. 28.5.3 Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM). Delineating the entire realm of aircrew responsibility.<br><br>during ACM is beyond the scope of this manual. Careful preplanning and briefing are necessary to ensure adequate crew coordination prior to any ACM mission. As a minimum, each flight member must have a constant awareness of the rules of engagement, flight safety, fuel state (including bingo), attitude, and minimum prebriefed base altitude and carry on a continuous supportive commentary.<br><br>. 28.6 EMERGENCIES.<br><br>Mission planning and briefing should address contingencies which may affect the flight. Proper planning minimizes the effect of deviations from the planned mission. The possibility of a mission abort or even the loss of an aircraft or aircrew can be significantly reduced by anticipating critical phases of flight and preparing for potential emergency situations. An example is the thorough brief of bird strike emergencies and divert fields along a low-level navigation route.<br>Part V contains procedures to correct an abnormal or emergency condition. Modify these procedures as required in case of multiple emergencies, adverse weather, or other peculiar factors. Use common sense and sound judgement to determine the correct course of action.<br>In dual crewmember aircraft, crew resource management is vital in an emergency situation. A plan should be discussed as to each crewmember’s actions during an emergency, i.e., the pilot controls aircraft and performs immediate action procedures, the crew member handles communication and confirms immediate action and follow on emergency procedures from the PCL are completed. A plan for both controlled and uncontrolled ejection should be discussed such as ejection selection handle setting, ejection warning voice calls, who initiates ejection, etc. Ground egress procedures should also be coordinated to preclude the ejection of an unstrapped crewmember and to deconflict egress routes.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALIX-28-5 (Reverse Blank).<br><br>

            CHAPTER 29.<br><br><br>NATOPS Evaluation.<br><br><br>. 29.1 CONCEPT.<br><br>The standard operating procedures prescribed in this manual represent the optimum method of operating the F/A-18 aircraft. The NATOPS Evaluation is intended to evaluate compliance with NATOPS procedures by observing and grading individuals and units. This evaluation is tailored for compatibility with various operational commitments and missions of both Navy and Marine Corps units. The prime objective of the NATOPS Evaluation program is to assist the unit commanding officer in improving unit readiness and safety through constructive comment. Maximum benefit from the NATOPS Program is achieved only through the vigorous support of the program by commanding officers as well as pilots.<br><br>. 29.1.1 Implementation. The NATOPS Evaluation program shall be carried out in every unit.<br><br>operating naval aircraft. Pilots desiring to attain/retain qualification in the F/A-18 shall be evaluated initially in accordance with OPNAVINST 3710.7 series, and at least once during the twelve months following initial and subsequent evaluations. Individual and unit NATOPS Evaluations will be conducted annually; however, instruction in and observation of adherence to NATOPS procedures must be on a daily basis within each unit to obtain maximum benefits from the program. The NATOPS Coordinators, Evaluators, and Instructors shall administer the program as outlined in OPNAVINST . 3710.7 series. Evaluees who receive a grade of Unqualified on a ground or flight evaluation shall beallowed 30 days in which to complete a reevaluation. A maximum of 60 days may elapse between the date the initial ground evaluation was commenced and the date the flight evaluation is satisfactorily completed.<br>. 29.1.2 Definitions. The following terms, used throughout this section, are defined as to their specificmeaning within the NATOPS program.<br><br>. 29.1.2.1 NATOPS Evaluation. A periodic evaluation of individual pilot standardization consisting of.<br><br>an open book examination, a closed book examination, an oral examination, and a flight evaluation.<br><br>. 29.1.2.2 NATOPS Reevaluation. A partial NATOPS Evaluation administered to a pilot who has.<br><br>been placed in an Unqualified status by receiving an Unqualified grade for any of his ground examinations or the flight evaluations. Only those areas in which an unsatisfactory level was noted need be observed during a reevaluation.<br><br>. 29.1.2.3 Qualified. Well standardized; evaluee demonstrated highly professional knowledge of and.<br><br>compliance with NATOPS standards and procedures; momentary deviations from or minor omission in non-critical areas are permitted if prompt and timely remedial action is initiated by the evaluee.<br><br>. 29.1.2.4 Conditionally Qualified. Satisfactorily standardized; one or more significant deviations.<br><br>from NATOPS standards and procedures, but no errors in critical areas and no errors jeopardizing mission accomplishment or flight safety.<br><br>. 29.1.2.5 Unqualified. Not acceptably standardized; evaluee fails to meet minimum standards.<br><br>regarding knowledge of and/or ability to apply NATOPS procedures, one or more significant <br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALX-29-1.<br><br>

            deviations from NATOPS standards and procedures which could jeopardize mission accomplishment or flight safety.<br><br>. 29.1.2.6 Area. A routine of preflight, flight or postflight.<br><br><br>. 29.1.2.7 Sub-area. A performance sub-division within an area, which is observed and evaluated.<br><br>during an evaluation flight.<br><br>. 29.1.2.8 Critical Area/Sub-area. Any area or sub-area which covers items of significant importance.<br><br>to the overall mission requirements, the marginal performance of which would jeopardize safe conduct of the flight.<br><br>. 29.1.2.9 Emergency. An aircraft component, system failure, or condition which requires instanta-.<br><br>neous recognition, analysis, and proper action.<br><br>. 29.1.2.10 Malfunction. An aircraft component or system failure or condition which requires.<br><br>recognition and analysis, but which permits more deliberate action than that required for an emergency.<br><br>. 29.2 GROUND EVALUATION.<br><br><br>. 29.2.1 General. Prior to commencing the flight evaluation, an evaluee must achieve a minimum.<br><br>grade of Qualified on the open book and closed book examinations. The oral examination is also part of the ground evaluation but may be conducted as part of the flight evaluation. To assure a degree of standardization between units, the NATOPS instructors may use the bank of questions contained in this section in preparing portions of the written examinations.<br><br>. 29.2.1.1 Open Book Examination. The open book examination shall consist of, but not be limited.<br><br>to, the question bank. The purpose of the open book examination portion of the written examination is to evaluate the pilot’s knowledge of appropriate publications and the aircraft.<br><br>. 29.2.1.2 Closed Book Examination. The closed book examination may be taken from, but not.<br><br>limited to, the question bank and shall include questions concerning normal/emergency procedures and aircraft limitations. Questions designated critical are so marked.<br><br>. 29.2.1.3 Oral Examination. The questions may be taken from this manual and drawn from the.<br><br>experience of the Instructor/Evaluator. Such questions should be direct and positive and should in no way be opinionated.<br><br>. 29.2.1.4 OFT/WST Procedures Evaluation. An OFT may be used to assist in measuring the pilot’s.<br><br>efficiency in the execution of normal operating procedures and his reaction to emergencies and malfunctions. In areas not served by an OFT, this may be done by placing the pilot in an aircraft and administering appropriate questions.<br><br>. 29.2.1.5 NAMT Systems Check. If desired by the individual squadron, Naval Air Maintenance.<br><br>Trainer facilities may be utilized to evaluate pilot knowledge of aircraft systems and normal and emergency procedures.<br><br>. 29.2.1.6 Grading Instructions. Examination grades shall be computed on a 4.0 scale and converted.<br><br>to an adjective grade of Qualified or Unqualified.<br><br>A1-F18AC-NFM-000.<br><br><br>ORIGINALX-29-2.<br><br>

The adjective grade shall then be determined on the basis of the following scale.<br>. 0.0 to 2.19 - Unqualified. 2.2 to 2.99 - Conditionally Qualified. 3.0 to 4.0 - QualifiedEXAMPLE: (Add Sub-area numerical equivalents) (4+2+4+2+4) ÷ 5 =3.20 Qualified <br>. 29.3.13.1 Final Grade Determination. The final NATOPS evaluation grade shall be the same as the.<br><br>grade assigned to the flight evaluation. An evaluee who receives an Unqualified on any ground examination or the flight evaluation shall be placed in an Unqualified status until he achieves a grade of Conditionally Qualified or Qualified on a reevaluation.<br><br>. 29.3.13.2 Records and Reports. A NATOPS Evaluation Report (OPNAV Form 3510-8) shall be.<br><br>completed for each evaluation and forwarded to the evaluee’s commanding officer only. This report shall be permanently filed in the individual NATOPS Flight Personnel Training/Qualification jacket.<br><br>. 29.3.13.3 Critique. The critique is the terminal point in the NATOPS evaluation and is given by the.<br><br>Evaluator/Instructor administering the check. Preparation for the critique involves processing, reconstructing data collected, and oral presentation of the NATOPS Evaluation Report. Deviations from standard operating procedures will be covered in detail using all collected data and worksheets as a guide. Upon completion of the critique, the pilot will receive the completed copy of the NATOPS Evaluation Report for certification and signature. The completed NATOPS Evaluation Report is then presented to the Unit Commanding Officer.<br><br>. 29.3.13.4 NATOPS Evaluation Question Bank. The following bank of questions is intended to assist.<br><br>the unit NATOPS Instructor/Evaluator in the preparation of ground examinations and to provide an abbreviated study guide. The questions from the bank may be combined with locally originated questions in the preparation of ground examinations. The closed book exam shall consist of no less than 50 questions. The time limit for the closed book exam is 1 hour and 30 minutes.
